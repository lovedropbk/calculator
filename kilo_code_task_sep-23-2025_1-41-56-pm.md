<task>
hi, can you continue to implement the redesign of the financial calculator according to 'docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md' (see below for file content)  specs. additinally,  :

there's another big change: we should automatically calculate (for finance options) the dealer commission paid for each option (based on predefined % for each product), and then display that as part of the "value prop" for sales. so for cash discount iw ill be 0, but for the other options, it should be based on these parameters.this should be displayed in the campaign options tile.
</task>

  1 | # Financial Calculator - UI Redesign Draft
  2 | 
  3 | Purpose: decision-first layout that lets sales enter a single Subsidy budget and instantly compare campaign options, while making IDCs explicit and overridable.
  4 | 
  5 | Author: Roo

  7 | 
  8 | ## Objectives
  9 | 
 10 | - Provide a top-level Subsidy budget input used to compute candidate campaign options and their key KPIs.
 11 | - Show a campaign comparison area immediately below the budget.
 12 | - Selecting a campaign reveals its details and full KPIs on the right.
 13 | - "IDCs - Dealer Commissions" auto-calculated from Product (HP, Finance Lease, etc.) with click-to-override and reset to auto.
 14 | - "IDCs - Other" free-entry bucket used for any other IDCs; when a campaign is selected, its cost is populated here by default.
 15 | - Guardrails enforce deal constraints; non-viable campaigns are greyed out with reasons.
 16 |

 61 | ## Interaction Model
 62 | 
 63 | - Product changes:
 64 |   - Recompute "IDCs - Dealer Commissions" auto value using product-specific policy/rules.
 65 |   - If previously overridden, keep the override but show "overridden" with a "Reset to auto" control.
 66 | - Subsidy budget:
 67 |   - Requests candidate campaign options from the campaign engine; options exceeding budget are disabled with reason tooltips.
 68 |   - Updates KPIs in the grid in real time (debounced).
 69 | - Campaign selection:
 70 |   - Sets "IDCs - Other" to the selected campaign's Subsidy by default.
 71 |   - If "IDCs - Other" was user-edited, prompt to replace with the campaign's Subsidy amount (Yes/No).
 72 |   - Shows right-side details and recomputes full metrics for the selection.
 73 | - IDCs - Dealer Commissions:
 74 |   - Displayed as a pill: "auto: X% (THB Y)". Click to toggle override editor (percent or amount).
 75 |   - Provide "Reset to auto" button and indicate overridden state.
 76 | - IDCs - Other:
 77 |   - Free numeric input; used for campaign fees and miscellaneous IDCs.
 78 |   - When campaign changes, behavior as above (auto-fill unless user-edited).
 79 | - Rate Mode:
 80 |   - Fixed Rate: show Customer Rate; hide Target Installment.
 81 |   - Target Installment: show Target Installment; hide Customer Rate; recompute feasibility.
 82 | 
 83 | ## Campaign Options Grid
 84 | 
 85 | Columns:
 86 | - Select (radio)
 87 | - Campaign
 88 | - Monthly Installment (with Effective Rate in brackets)
 89 | - Downpayment Amount (and % of vehicle price)
 90 | - Subsidy / Acq.RoRAC (Subsidy maps to IDCs - Other; initial value = Subsidy budget)
 91 | - Notes (reasons, warnings, inclusions like "free insurance")
 92 | 
 93 | Sorting and filters:
 94 | - Default sort by Monthly Installment ascending.
 95 | - Secondary sort by Effective Rate.
 96 | - Toggle to show only viable campaigns within budget.
 97 | 
 98 | ## IDCs Logic
 99 | 
100 | - Dealer Commissions:
101 |   - Auto-calculated from Product (HP, Finance Lease, etc.), potentially also dependent on term, DP%, timing, or parameters.
102 |   - Represented and stored as both percent and amount; the UI shows both for clarity.
103 |   - Overrides persist for the session; "Reset to auto" restores the policy-derived value.
104 | - Other:
105 |   - Holds the selected campaign subsidy amount when a campaign is selected.
106 |   - May be edited freely; flagged as "user-edited" to control auto-fill behavior on campaign change.
107 | - IDC Total = Dealer Commissions (amount) + Other.
108 | 
109 | ## State Model (conceptual)
110 | 
111 | - DealState
112 |   - Product, Term, Timing, Balloon, DownPayment, LockMode, RateMode, CustomerRate, TargetInstallment
113 |   - SubsidyBudget
114 |   - DealerCommission: { mode: auto|override, pct?: number, amt?: number, resolvedAmt: number }
115 |   - IDC_Other: { value: number, userEdited: boolean }
116 |   - SelectedCampaign?: CampaignId
117 | - Derived
118 |   - CampaignSummaries[] from campaigns engine (budget-applied)
119 |   - SelectedCampaignDetail
120 |   - Metrics from pricing/cashflow/profitability
121 | 
122 | ## Data Flow
123 | 
124 | 1) Inputs change -> validate -> throttle/debounce -> query campaigns engine for summaries.
125 | 2) Grid updates; disabled rows show reasons when not viable.
126 | 3) Selecting a campaign sets IDC_Other from the selected row's Subsidy and triggers full recompute via pricing/cashflow/profitability.
127 | 4) Right pane shows computed KPIs and details; left grid stays for comparisons.
128 | 
129 | ## Validation & Guardrails
130 | 
131 | - Numeric ranges checked inline; show unit-aware messages.
132 | - For Target Installment, compute feasibility; if infeasible, suggest nearest feasible rate.
133 | - Budget guardrails: campaign Subsidy must not exceed Subsidy budget; if combined IDCs exceed policy caps, show warnings and disable actions as needed.
134 | 
135 | ## Walk UI Implementation Plan (phased)
136 | 
137 | Phase 1 - Structure
138 | - Replace campaign checkboxes with a ListView grid and radio selection.
139 | - Add "Subsidy budget" input and the IDCs section (Dealer Commissions with auto/override; Other).
140 | - Add right pane Splitter with "Key Metrics" and "Campaign Details".
141 | 
142 | Phase 2 - Wiring
143 | - Introduce DealState view-model; bind form fields.
144 | - Implement Dealer Commission auto lookup from parameters by product; support override.
145 | - Integrate campaigns engine to produce CampaignSummaries given Subsidy budget and DealState.
146 | 
147 | Phase 3 - Metrics and Details
148 | - On selection, compute metrics using pricing/cashflow/profitability with campaign modifiers.
149 | - Populate right pane; update IDC_Other default and user-edited logic.
150 | 
151 | Phase 4 - UX Polish
152 | - Debounce recomputes; show loading and warnings.
153 | - Add Export/Save actions; print-ready summary.
154 | - Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility improvements.
155 | 
156 | ## Open Questions
157 | 
158 | - Dealer Commission policy exact drivers (product-only vs. product+term+DP%+channel?).
159 | - Campaign catalog: which parameters are user-tunable per campaign vs. fixed?
160 | - Are there global caps for total IDCs by product or deal size?
161 | - Should campaign cost ever be split between Dealer Commission and Other?
162 | 
163 | ## Notes
164 | 
165 | - "Subsidy" in the grid is written to "IDCs - Other". Users can override afterward.
166 | - The right pane is authoritative for the currently selected campaign. The top headline can mirror Monthly Installment and Effective Rate for quick reading.
167 | - Keep computations deterministic and traceable; surface parameter version and calc time for auditability.

Plan to proceed
- Implement the redesign per [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md), and add the new requirement: auto-calculate dealer commission per finance option (0 for Cash Discount) from product-specific percentages, and surface it in each campaign tile as part of the sales “value prop”.
- Execute in phases: update spec → implement parameters and engine → update UI (Walk) → tests and build.

Next I’ll set up a tracked checklist, then start with an Architect subtask to lock the exact policy, formula, and UI placement. After that, I’ll delegate engine and UI changes in Code mode.

<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[-] Author commission policy + UI spec updates in docs (additions to docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md; reflect tile "value prop" placement for Dealer Commission; specify formula & product-level %s)
[ ] Implement parameters: add CommissionPolicy schema and loader in parameters/ (with defaults), wire into parameters/service.go
[ ] Extend domain model: add DealState fields for DealerCommission and IDC_Other in engines/types/types.go
[ ] Implement commission auto-lookup utility using product-based % → amount given current deal inputs
[ ] Update engines/campaigns/campaigns.go to compute per-option Dealer Commission (0 for Cash Discount) and include it in CampaignSummaries payload for UI
[ ] Walk UI Phase 1: structure updates (Subsidy budget input, IDCs section with Dealer Commissions pill and IDCs - Other; radio ListView grid)
[ ] Walk UI Phase 2: wiring DealState bindings; auto/override logic for Dealer Commissions pill with "Reset to auto"
[ ] Walk UI: surface "Dealer Comm: THB X (Y%)" in each campaign tile/value-prop; show 0 for Cash Discount
[ ] Selection behavior: set IDCs - Other from selected campaign’s Subsidy; respect user-edited flag and prompt to replace
[ ] Tests: unit tests for commission policy and campaigns calculations; build scripts verified (walk/scripts/build.ps1 and go build)

<new_task>
<mode>architect</mode>
<message>
Context
- We are continuing the redesign described in [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md).
- New requirement: automatically calculate the dealer commission for each finance campaign option using a predefined percent by product; display that commission as part of the campaign tile’s “value prop.” For Cash Discount, commission must be 0.

Scope
Update the documentation only. Do not modify code. Make the following documentation changes in-place:
1) In [docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md](docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md), add a new section that fully specifies “Dealer Commission Policy” and the end-to-end behavior:
   - Policy drivers and storage
     - Commission is determined by product-level percentage (HP, Finance Lease, etc.) with a clear statement that the model can be extended later to include term, DP%, timing, channel, etc.
     - Define storage under the parameters service, with an explicit JSON shape example (numbers can be placeholders, clearly marked):
       {
         "commissionPolicy": {
           "byProductPct": {
             "HP": 0.015,
             "FinanceLease": 0.0125,
             "BalloonHP": 0.016
           },
           "version": "2025.09",
           "notes": "Example defaults; replace via parameter sync"
         }
       }
     - Document fallbacks: if product not found or policy missing, default to 0%.
   - Calculation definition
     - Commission base amount = Financed Amount = Vehicle Price – Down Payment (align with existing definition of Financed Amount used by engines).
     - Commission percent = policy lookup by product (or override if provided in the deal).
     - Resolved Commission Amount = round(Commission base × Commission percent) to the nearest THB.
   - Override model and behavior
     - Dealer Commission has mode auto or override.
     - Override may specify percent or amount; resolved amount reflects whichever override is active (if both provided, amount takes precedence).
     - “Reset to auto” restores policy-based calculation.
     - Overrides persist for the session.
   - Integration with deal state
     - Extend DealState conceptual model with:
       DealerCommission: { mode: auto | override, pct?: number, amt?: number, resolvedAmt: number }
       IDC_Other: { value: number, userEdited: boolean }
     - IDC Total = Dealer Commission (resolved amount) + IDC Other (unchanged).
   - Campaigns engine outputs
     - Campaign summaries must include a per-option Dealer Commission value for tile display:
       - For finance options (e.g., Subdown, Subinterest, Free Insurance, Free MBSP): use the resolved Dealer Commission amount (typically the same across options for a given deal, as it’s product- and deal-driven).
       - For Cash Discount: force Dealer Commission to 0 (0%).
     - Note: Even if equal across options, surfacing this highlights the value difference versus Cash Discount.
   - UI wiring and display
     - Top section: keep “IDCs - Dealer Commissions” pill showing “auto: Y% (THB X)”, with override editor (percent or amount) and “Reset to auto.”
     - Campaign Options grid: add “Dealer Comm.: THB X (Y%)” to the visible “value prop” line for each tile. For Cash Discount, display “THB 0 (0%).”
     - Right pane metrics: ensure IDC Total remains the sum of Dealer Commission and Other; show both components explicitly.
   - Data flow updates
     - On product/term/downpayment/timing changes, recompute the auto Dealer Commission resolved amount.
     - On campaign fetch, include the per-option Dealer Commission for display; selecting a campaign still maps “Subsidy” to IDC Other per the redesign spec.
   - Edge cases and guardrails
     - Unknown product or missing parameter: default Commission percent = 0%, display a warning badge in UI (non-blocking).
     - Rounding: nearest THB; negative values disallowed.
     - Cash Discount always 0 (0%) regardless of overrides.
   - Acceptance criteria
     - Provide AC bullets covering calculation correctness, override behavior, tile display for all options, and Cash Discount special case.

2) In [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md), reflect these visual and interaction changes:
   - Update Campaign Options Grid section to include a “Dealer Comm.: THB X (Y%)” component in the tile’s value prop. Add explicit note: Cash Discount shows THB 0 (0%).
   - In the Interaction Model and IDCs Logic sections, clarify that Dealer Commission is auto-calculated from product policy and can be overridden, with a pill that shows “auto: Y% (THB X)” and a “Reset to auto” action.
   - In the State Model and Data Flow sections, align with the new fields and per-option display behavior, and note that campaigns engine returns the per-option Dealer Commission used in tiles.
   - Add a “Commission Policy Defaults” note indicating these values are parameterized and versioned, and may be updated by parameter sync.

Constraints
- Only perform the documentation edits described above. Do not change any code.
- Maintain existing writing tone, structure, and formatting of both docs; integrate seamlessly.
- Keep numbers in the JSON sample clearly labeled as examples; do not imply they are final policy values.

Completion signal
- After updating both docs, use the attempt_completion tool with a concise summary of what changed, including the exact sections added/modified and a short diff-style bullet list of key additions.

Note
- These instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for Architect mode for this subtask.</message>

      {
        "commissionPolicy": {
          "byProductPct": {
            "HP": 0.015,
            "FinanceLease": 0.0125,
            "BalloonHP": 0.016
          },
          "version": "2025.09",
          "notes": "Example defaults; replace via parameter sync"
        }
      }
    - Fallbacks: product not found or policy missing → percent defaults to 0%
    - Calculation definition:
      - Commission base amount = Financed Amount = Vehicle Price (after any Cash Discount) − Down Payment; rounded to nearest THB
      - Commission percent = policy by product or percent override if provided
      - Resolved amount = round(base × percent)
    - Override model: mode=auto|override; percent or amount; amount takes precedence; “Reset to auto”; persists for session
    - Integration with deal state:
      - DealerCommission: { mode: auto | override, pct?: number, amt?: number, resolvedAmt: number }
      - IDC_Other: { value: number, userEdited: boolean }
      - IDC Total = Dealer Commission + IDC Other
    - Campaign engine outputs: per-option Dealer Commission for tiles; finance options use resolved value; Cash Discount forced 0 (0%)
    - UI wiring: top pill “auto: Y% (THB X)”; tiles show “Dealer Comm.: THB X (Y%)”; right pane shows IDC Total components
    - Data flow updates: recompute auto commission on product/term/DP/timing change; include per-option commission in campaign fetch
    - Edge cases: unknown product/policy → 0% with non-blocking warning; rounding to nearest THB; negative disallowed; Cash Discount always 0
    - Acceptance criteria: correctness, overrides, tile display, Cash Discount special case

UI redesign doc changes
- Campaign Options Grid
  - Added column: “Dealer Comm.: THB X (Y%)” with note “Cash Discount shows THB 0 (0%).”
- Interaction Model
  - Clarified commission auto-calculation from parameters-backed product policy; keep override with “Reset to auto”; non-blocking warning if policy missing
  - Pill copy shows “auto: X% (THB Y)”
- IDCs Logic
  - Clarified auto calculation from policy; base = Vehicle Price − Down Payment (aligned with engines), rounded to nearest THB
  - Overrides: percent or amount; amount precedence; session persistence; reset behavior
  - Guardrails: default 0% if policy/product missing; negative disallowed; Cash Discount always THB 0 (0%)
- State Model (Derived)
  - CampaignSummaries[] now includes dealerCommissionAmt and dealerCommissionPct for tile display
- Data Flow
  - Step 1 recomputes auto Dealer Commission (if mode=auto) and queries campaigns engine including per-option Dealer Commission; IDC Total in right pane remains Dealer Commission + Other with both shown
- New section: “Commission Policy Defaults”
  - Notes values are parameterized and versioned; examples are illustrative only; live defaults come from active ParameterSet via parameter sync; UI shows active ParameterSet version

Diff-style summary of key additions
- + Added “8.1 Dealer Commission Policy — end-to-end behavior” with storage, JSON shape, fallbacks, calc, overrides, data flow, and ACs in [docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md](docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md)
- + Commission base = Financed Amount = Vehicle Price (after any Cash Discount) − Down Payment; rounded to nearest THB
- + Overrides: percent or amount; amount precedence; “Reset to auto”; session persistence
- + Campaign engine outputs now include per-option Dealer Commission; Cash Discount forced 0 (0%)
- + UI: top pill shows “auto: Y% (THB X)”; tiles display “Dealer Comm.: THB X (Y%)”; right pane IDC Total remains Dealer Commission + Other
- + Edge/guardrails: unknown product/policy → 0% with warning; negatives disallowed; rounding clarified
- + Added “Commission Policy Defaults” section in [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md); updated Interaction Model, IDCs Logic, State Model, Data Flow, and Grid columns to reflect per-option commission

No code was modified; only documentation edits were made as requested.

**User:**

[new_task in Architect mode: 'Context
- We are continuing the redesign described in [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md).
- New requirement: automatically calculate the dealer commission for each finance campaign option using a predefined percent by product; display that commission as part of the campaign tile’s “value prop.” For Cash Discount, commission must be 0.

Scope
Update the documentation only. Do not modify code. Make the following documentation changes in-place:
1) In [docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md](docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md), add a new section that fully specifies “Dealer Commission Policy” and the end-to-end behavior:
   - Policy drivers and storage
     - Commission is determined by product-level percentage (HP, Finance Lease, etc.) with a clear statement that the model can be extended later to include term, DP%, timing, channel, etc.
     - Define storage under the parameters service, with an explicit JSON shape example (numbers can be placeholders, clearly marked):
       {
         "commissionPolicy": {
           "byProductPct": {
             "HP": 0.015,
             "FinanceLease": 0.0125,
             "BalloonHP": 0.016
           },
           "version": "2025.09",
           "notes": "Example defaults; replace via parameter sync"
         }
       }
     - Document fallbacks: if product not found or policy missing, default to 0%.
   - Calculation definition
     - Commission base amount = Financed Amount = Vehicle Price – Down Payment (align with existing definition of Financed Amount used by engines).
     - Commission percent = policy lookup by product (or override if provided in the deal).
     - Resolved Commission Amount = round(Commission base × Commission percent) to the nearest THB.
   - Override model and behavior
     - Dealer Commission has mode auto or override.
     - Override may specify percent or amount; resolved amount reflects whichever override is active (if both provided, amount takes precedence).
     - “Reset to auto” restores policy-based calculation.
     - Overrides persist for the session.
   - Integration with deal state
     - Extend DealState conceptual model with:
       DealerCommission: { mode: auto | override, pct?: number, amt?: number, resolvedAmt: number }
       IDC_Other: { value: number, userEdited: boolean }
     - IDC Total = Dealer Commission (resolved amount) + IDC Other (unchanged).
   - Campaigns engine outputs
     - Campaign summaries must include a per-option Dealer Commission value for tile display:
       - For finance options (e.g., Subdown, Subinterest, Free Insurance, Free MBSP): use the resolved Dealer Commission amount (typically the same across options for a given deal, as it’s product- and deal-driven).
       - For Cash Discount: force Dealer Commission to 0 (0%).
     - Note: Even if equal across options, surfacing this highlights the value difference versus Cash Discount.
   - UI wiring and display
     - Top section: keep “IDCs - Dealer Commissions” pill showing “auto: Y% (THB X)”, with override editor (percent or amount) and “Reset to auto.”
     - Campaign Options grid: add “Dealer Comm.: THB X (Y%)” to the visible “value prop” line for each tile. For Cash Discount, display “THB 0 (0%).”
     - Right pane metrics: ensure IDC Total remains the sum of Dealer Commission and Other; show both components explicitly.
   - Data flow updates
     - On product/term/downpayment/timing changes, recompute the auto Dealer Commission resolved amount.
     - On campaign fetch, include the per-option Dealer Commission for display; selecting a campaign still maps “Subsidy” to IDC Other per the redesign spec.
   - Edge cases and guardrails
     - Unknown product or missing parameter: default Commission percent = 0%, display a warning badge in UI (non-blocking).
     - Rounding: nearest THB; negative values disallowed.
     - Cash Discount always 0 (0%) regardless of overrides.
   - Acceptance criteria
     - Provide AC bullets covering calculation correctness, override behavior, tile display for all options, and Cash Discount special case.

2) In [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md), reflect these visual and interaction changes:
   - Update Campaign Options Grid section to include a “Dealer Comm.: THB X (Y%)” component in the tile’s value prop. Add explicit note: Cash Discount shows THB 0 (0%).
   - In the Interaction Model and IDCs Logic sections, clarify that Dealer Commission is auto-calculated from product policy and can be overridden, with a pill that shows “auto: Y% (THB X)” and a “Reset to auto” action.
   - In the State Model and Data Flow sections, align with the new fields and per-option display behavior, and note that campaigns engine returns the per-option Dealer Commission used in tiles.
   - Add a “Commission Policy Defaults” note indicating these values are parameterized and versioned, and may be updated by parameter sync.

Constraints
- Only perform the documentation edits described above. Do not change any code.
- Maintain existing writing tone, structure, and formatting of both docs; integrate seamlessly.
- Keep numbers in the JSON sample clearly labeled as examples; do not imply they are final policy values.

Completion signal
- After updating both docs, use the attempt_completion tool with a concise summary of what changed, including the exact sections added/modified and a short diff-style bullet list of key additions.

**Assistant:**

<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>
Context
- We’re continuing the redesign described in [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md) and the newly updated policy section in [docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md](docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md).
- Goal of this subtask (Todo #2): Implement CommissionPolicy in the parameters layer and expose simple getters for use by engines/UI. No engine/UI changes in this subtask.

Scope
Edit only the parameters package to add CommissionPolicy and accessors. Do not modify engines or walk UI in this subtask.

Required changes
1) Types
   - In [parameters/types.go](parameters/types.go), add:
     - language.declaration(): 
       - type CommissionPolicy struct { ByProductPct map[string]float64 `json:"byProductPct"`; Version string `json:"version"`; Notes string `json:"notes,omitempty"` }
     - Extend the root parameter struct (e.g., ParameterSet or equivalent) with a new field:
       - CommissionPolicy CommissionPolicy `json:"commissionPolicy,omitempty"`
     - Add godoc comments referencing the architecture spec so the JSON shape matches the example specified in that doc.

2) Loading and storage
   - Ensure the new field is loaded from persisted parameter files via the existing storage path:
     - Update [parameters/storage.go](parameters/storage.go) to include CommissionPolicy in any unmarshal/marshal logic already present.
     - If no CommissionPolicy is present, treat the effective policy as 0% across all products (fallback behavior).
   - Confirm [parameters/sync.go](parameters/sync.go) copies/syncs this field as part of parameter synchronization (if applicable in this codebase; adapt to current sync conventions).

3) Service accessors
   - In [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go), add:
     - language.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64
       - Behavior: 
         - Lookup s.activeParams.CommissionPolicy.ByProductPct[product] (case-sensitive to match existing product keys; do not transform).
         - If missing policy or product key, return 0.0.
     - language.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPolicyVersion() string
       - Behavior:
         - If CommissionPolicy present and Version non-empty, return it; else return an empty string (or a sentinel like "unversioned" if that is the convention in this repo—prefer empty string if unsure).
   - Add minimal inline validation in CommissionPercentByProduct to guard against negative values in parameters (if negative, clamp at 0 and optionally log at debug level if the codebase has logging; if no logger, omit logging).

4) Defaults and safety
   - Do not hardcode non-zero defaults in code. The architecture doc states example values are illustrative only. Fallback must be 0%.
   - Ensure existing parameter loading remains backward-compatible: older parameter files without CommissionPolicy still load successfully.

5) Build and basic verification
   - Ensure `go build ./...` succeeds at the repository root.
   - Optional (only if quick to add without broader ripple effects): a small unit test file in parameters validating:
     - unknown product returns 0
     - known product in a constructed ParameterSet returns the configured pct
     - CommissionPolicyVersion returns the configured version or empty string if none
   - If adding tests now would touch broader setup, skip and confirm compilation only. We have a separate Todo item for full test coverage.

Notes and constraints
- Match existing coding style and error-handling patterns in the parameters package.
- Do not introduce new external dependencies.
- Keep API additions minimal and focused (two methods only).
- This subtask should not change any files outside parameters/.

Acceptance criteria
- Compiles successfully (no linter or vet regressions if these are part of CI).
- parameters.Service exposes:
  - language.declaration(): CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64 with 0% fallback
  - language.declaration(): CommissionPolicyVersion() string
- Loading parameters with and without the new commissionPolicy section works (backward compatible).
- No behavior change elsewhere (engines/UI untouched).

Completion signal
- Use the attempt_completion tool with a concise summary:
  - Files changed and new declarations added (list as clickable links e.g., [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go)).
  - Confirmation of build success.
  - Any notes on minor deviations (e.g., if tests skipped).

Important
- Only implement what’s in this message. Do not extend to engine/UI changes in this subtask. These instructions supersede general mode guidelines for this task.</message>
</new_task>

**User:**

[new_task completed] Result: Implemented CommissionPolicy in parameters with accessors and ensured backward-compatible loading.

Files changed
- [parameters/types.go](parameters/types.go)
  - Added [go.declaration(): type CommissionPolicy struct](parameters/types.go:74)
  - Extended ParameterSet with [go.declaration(): CommissionPolicy CommissionPolicy `json:"commissionPolicy,omitempty"`](parameters/types.go:33) and added doc comments referencing architecture spec
- [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go)
  - Added [go.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64](parameters/service.go:580)
  - Added [go.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPolicyVersion() string](parameters/service.go:609)

Behavior and loading/storage
- Storage and sync continue to marshal/unmarshal the full ParameterSet via JSON; the new commissionPolicy field is included automatically. Older parameter files without this section still load successfully.
- Accessors:
  - CommissionPercentByProduct: case-sensitive lookup; if policy or product key missing, returns 0.0; negative values are clamped to 0.0.
  - CommissionPolicyVersion: returns configured version if present; otherwise empty string.
- No non-zero defaults introduced (fallback remains 0%).

Build verification
- Built successfully: go build ./... exited with code 0.

Notes
- No engine/UI changes in this subtask, as required.
- Unit tests were skipped for now; compilation confirmed.

Clickable references
- [parameters/types.go](parameters/types.go)
- [go.declaration(): type CommissionPolicy struct](parameters/types.go:74)
- [go.declaration(): CommissionPolicy CommissionPolicy `json:"commissionPolicy,omitempty"`](parameters/types.go:33)
- [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go)
- [go.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64](parameters/service.go:580)
- [go.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPolicyVersion() string](parameters/service.go:609)

3) Service accessors
   - In [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go), add:
     - language.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64
       - Behavior: 
         - Lookup s.activeParams.CommissionPolicy.ByProductPct[product] (case-sensitive to match existing product keys; do not transform).
         - If missing policy or product key, return 0.0.
     - language.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPolicyVersion() string
       - Behavior:
         - If CommissionPolicy present and Version non-empty, return it; else return an empty string (or a sentinel like "unversioned" if that is the convention in this repo—prefer empty string if unsure).
   - Add minimal inline validation in CommissionPercentByProduct to guard against negative values in parameters (if negative, clamp at 0 and optionally log at debug level if the codebase has logging; if no logger, omit logging).

4) Defaults and safety
   - Do not hardcode non-zero defaults in code. The architecture doc states example values are illustrative only. Fallback must be 0%.
   - Ensure existing parameter loading remains backward-compatible: older parameter files without CommissionPolicy still load successfully.

5) Build and basic verification
   - Ensure `go build ./...` succeeds at the repository root.
   - Optional (only if quick to add without broader ripple effects): a small unit test file in parameters validating:
     - unknown product returns 0
     - known product in a constructed ParameterSet returns the configured pct
     - CommissionPolicyVersion returns the configured version or empty string if none
   - If adding tests now would touch broader setup, skip and confirm compilation only. We have a separate Todo item for full test coverage.

Notes and constraints
- Match existing coding style and error-handling patterns in the parameters package.
- Do not introduce new external dependencies.
- Keep API additions minimal and focused (two methods only).
- This subtask should not change any files outside parameters/.

Acceptance criteria
- Compiles successfully (no linter or vet regressions if these are part of CI).
- parameters.Service exposes:
  - language.declaration(): CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64 with 0% fallback
  - language.declaration(): CommissionPolicyVersion() string
- Loading parameters with and without the new commissionPolicy section works (backward compatible).
- No behavior change elsewhere (engines/UI untouched).

Completion signal
- Use the attempt_completion tool with a concise summary:
  - Files changed and new declarations added (list as clickable links e.g., [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go)).
  - Confirmation of build success.
  - Any notes on minor deviations (e.g., if tests skipped).

Successfully created new task in Code mode with message: Context
- We’re continuing the redesign described in [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md) and the newly updated policy section in [docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md](docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md).
- Goal of this subtask (Todo #2): Implement CommissionPolicy in the parameters layer and expose simple getters for use by engines/UI. No engine/UI changes in this subtask.

Scope
Edit only the parameters package to add CommissionPolicy and accessors. Do not modify engines or walk UI in this subtask.

Required changes
1) Types
   - In [parameters/types.go](parameters/types.go), add:
     - language.declaration(): 
       - type CommissionPolicy struct { ByProductPct map[string]float64 `json:"byProductPct"`; Version string `json:"version"`; Notes string `json:"notes,omitempty"` }
     - Extend the root parameter struct (e.g., ParameterSet or equivalent) with a new field:
       - CommissionPolicy CommissionPolicy `json:"commissionPolicy,omitempty"`
     - Add godoc comments referencing the architecture spec so the JSON shape matches the example specified in that doc.

2) Loading and storage
   - Ensure the new field is loaded from persisted parameter files via the existing storage path:
     - Update [parameters/storage.go](parameters/storage.go) to include CommissionPolicy in any unmarshal/marshal logic already present.
     - If no CommissionPolicy is present, treat the effective policy as 0% across all products (fallback behavior).
   - Confirm [parameters/sync.go](parameters/sync.go) copies/syncs this field as part of parameter synchronization (if applicable in this codebase; adapt to current sync conventions).

3) Service accessors
   - In [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go), add:
     - language.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64
       - Behavior: 
         - Lookup s.activeParams.CommissionPolicy.ByProductPct[product] (case-sensitive to match existing product keys; do not transform).
         - If missing policy or product key, return 0.0.
     - language.declaration(): func (s *Service) CommissionPolicyVersion() string
       - Behavior:
         - If CommissionPolicy present and Version non-empty, return it; else return an empty string (or a sentinel like "unversioned" if that is the convention in this repo—prefer empty string if unsure).

<message>
Context
- Continue the redesign per [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md) and the architecture updates already landed.
- Targeting Todo #3: Extend the domain model (DealState) to support Dealer Commission auto/override and IDC Other user-edited tracking.

Scope
Implement domain model changes only in engines/types. Do not wire calculations or engine/UX behavior in this subtask.

Required changes
1) In [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go):
   - Add Dealer Commission mode and structs:
     - language.declaration(): type DealerCommissionMode string
     - language.declaration(): const (
         DealerCommissionModeAuto DealerCommissionMode = "auto"
         DealerCommissionModeOverride DealerCommissionMode = "override"
       )
     - language.declaration(): type DealerCommission struct {
         Mode        DealerCommissionMode `json:"mode"`             // "auto" or "override"
         Pct         *float64             `json:"pct,omitempty"`    // optional override as fraction (e.g., 0.015)
         Amt         *float64             `json:"amt,omitempty"`    // optional override amount in THB; takes precedence if set
         ResolvedAmt float64              `json:"resolvedAmt"`      // computed/authoritative THB for current deal context
       }
     - language.declaration(): type IDCOther struct {
         Value      float64 `json:"value"`                         // THB amount for other IDCs (campaign fees etc.)
         UserEdited bool    `json:"userEdited"`                    // true if user modified; controls auto-fill on selection
       }
   - Extend DealState to include:
     - language.declaration(): DealerCommission DealerCommission `json:"dealerCommission"`
     - language.declaration(): IDCOther         IDCOther         `json:"idcOther"`
   - Add godoc comments referencing the new “Dealer Commission Policy” section in [docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md](docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md), clarifying:
     - Mode semantics (auto/override).
     - Override precedence (Amt over Pct).
     - IDC Total = DealerCommission.ResolvedAmt + IDCOther.Value (calculation will be performed elsewhere in later tasks).

2) Backward-compatibility and build
   - Ensure the repository builds after these changes. If any unkeyed composite literals for DealState exist and break due to the new fields, convert them to keyed form within the engines packages to restore compilation. Keep changes minimal and mechanical (no behavior changes).

Constraints
- Do not implement calculation logic here.
- Do not modify parameters, campaigns, pricing, or walk UI in this subtask (other than minimal compile fixes as noted).
- Keep naming idiomatic Go and JSON tags aligned with docs (lower-camel JSON).

Acceptance criteria
- go build ./... succeeds at the repository root.
- DealState now carries DealerCommission and IDCOther fields as specified.
- No behavior changes introduced (pure model extension only).

Completion signal
- Use the attempt_completion tool with:
  - The files changed with clickable references (e.g., [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go)).
  - The added declarations listed (language.declaration()).
  - Confirmation of build success.
  - Note if any compile fixes were required (e.g., converting unkeyed literals).

**User:**

[new_task completed] Result: Implemented domain model extensions for Dealer Commission and IDC Other in [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go).

Added declarations
- [language.declaration()](engines/types/types.go:359): type DealerCommissionMode string
- [language.declaration()](engines/types/types.go:361): const ( DealerCommissionModeAuto DealerCommissionMode = "auto"; DealerCommissionModeOverride DealerCommissionMode = "override" )
- [language.declaration()](engines/types/types.go:376): type DealerCommission struct { Mode DealerCommissionMode; Pct *float64; Amt *float64; ResolvedAmt float64 }
- [language.declaration()](engines/types/types.go:392): type IDCOther struct { Value float64; UserEdited bool }
- [language.declaration()](engines/types/types.go:402): type DealState struct { DealerCommission DealerCommission; IDCOther IDCOther }

Godoc notes (embedded in the file)
- References “8.1 Dealer Commission Policy — end-to-end behavior” in [docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md](docs/financial-calculator-architecture.md:129).
- Mode semantics: "auto" selects policy-driven commission; "override" allows user input.
- Override precedence: Amt (THB) takes precedence over Pct (fraction).
- IDC Total relationship documented for later implementation: DealerCommission.ResolvedAmt + IDCOther.Value (calculation performed elsewhere in subsequent tasks).

Backward compatibility and build
- Searched for DealState usage; none found, so no composite literal fixes were required.
- go build ./... executed successfully at repo root (exit code 0).

No behavior changes introduced
- Pure model extension only; no calculation wiring, no parameter/campaign/pricing/UX changes.

Files changed
- [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go)

<message>
Context
- Architecture and parameters support for CommissionPolicy are in place. Next is Todo #4: provide a reusable auto-lookup utility that converts product-based % → THB amount using current deal inputs (financed amount base).
- This utility will be used by campaigns and other engines subsequently.

Scope
Add a small, standalone helper in the engines layer to compute Dealer Commission (auto and resolved), leveraging [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go) accessors. Keep this subtask focused on adding the utility only; do not modify campaigns or UI yet.

   - Add a new file [engines/calculator/commission.go](engines/calculator/commission.go) (or extend [engines/calculator/calculator.go](engines/calculator/calculator.go) if preferred by local conventions). Prefer a new file for clarity.

2) Helpers to add
   - [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionAuto(params *parameters.Service, product string, financedAmt float64) (pct float64, amountTHB float64)]
     - Behavior:
       - pct := params.CommissionPercentByProduct(product) // already clamps negatives to 0
       - base := max(financedAmt, 0)
       - amountTHB := math.Round(base * pct)
       - return pct, amountTHB
   - [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionResolved(params *parameters.Service, deal types.DealState, financedAmt float64) (pct float64, amountTHB float64)]
     - Behavior (follows the architecture doc’s override rules):
       - If deal.DealerCommission.Mode == "override":
         - If deal.DealerCommission.Amt != nil: pct := 0 (unknown/irrelevant), amountTHB := max(round(*Amt), 0)
         - Else if deal.DealerCommission.Pct != nil: pct := max(*Pct, 0); amountTHB := round(max(financedAmt, 0) * pct)
         - Else: fall back to auto (treat like auto mode)
       - Else (auto): return ResolveDealerCommissionAuto(params, product, financedAmt)
       - Note: “product” should be derived from deal’s product field; see below.
     - Rationale:
       - Keeps core precedence: amount override > percent override > auto.
       - Rounding to nearest THB. Negative clamped to 0.

3) Financed amount input
   - The helper takes financedAmt as an argument by design to avoid duplicating any existing logic. Future callers (campaigns/pricing) can compute or fetch financedAmt using their established flows (e.g., Financed Amount = Vehicle Price − Down Payment per docs). If a common function already exists for financed amount, they can reuse it and pass the result here.

4) Product field source
   - Obtain product from the deal (e.g., deal.Product or equivalent that already exists in [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go)). If the exact name differs, adapt accordingly after inspecting the file; pass that product string to the params lookup.
   - If the product field is absent or empty, the params accessor returns 0 which is the defined fallback.

5) Error handling & imports
   - Use math.Round, clamp with simple max(…, 0). Don’t introduce new deps.
   - Keep the functions pure with no logging side effects.

6) Tests (optional)
   - If straightforward, add [engines/calculator/commission_test.go](engines/calculator/commission_test.go) with minimal cases:
     - Auto unknown product → (0, 0)
     - Auto known product with base → correct rounding
     - Override amount → amount used, pct 0
     - Override pct → computed amount, rounding correct
   - If adding tests requires broader setup, skip tests and ensure go build succeeds.

Acceptance criteria
- New helpers compiled and ready for reuse:
  - [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionAuto(params *parameters.Service, product string, financedAmt float64) (float64, float64)]
  - [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionResolved(params *parameters.Service, deal types.DealState, financedAmt float64) (float64, float64)]
- Build passes: go build ./... at repo root.
- No changes in campaigns or UI yet.

Completion signal
- Use the attempt_completion tool with:
  - Clickable references to new/updated files (e.g., [engines/calculator/commission.go](engines/calculator/commission.go)).
  - Enumerate added language.declaration()s.
  - Confirm build success.
  - Note whether tests were added or skipped.

Notes
- Keep the code idiomatic and small. These instructions supersede any general mode guidance for this subtask.

**User:**

[new_task completed] Result: Added a reusable dealer commission auto-lookup utility in the engines layer and verified build success.

What’s new
- New file: [engines/calculator/commission.go](engines/calculator/commission.go)
- Declarations:
  - [go.declaration(): type CommissionLookup interface { CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64 }](engines/calculator/commission.go:12)
  - [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionAuto(params CommissionLookup, product string, financedAmt float64) (pct float64, amountTHB float64)](engines/calculator/commission.go:19)
  - [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionResolved(params CommissionLookup, deal types.DealState, financedAmt float64) (pct float64, amountTHB float64)](engines/calculator/commission.go:43)

Behavior
- Auto mode:
  - pct := params.CommissionPercentByProduct(product) (accessor already clamps negatives to 0)
  - base := max(financedAmt, 0)
  - amountTHB := math.Round(base * pct)
- Resolved mode precedence:
  - Amount override (Amt) → pct = 0; amountTHB = round(max(override, 0))
  - Else Percent override (Pct) → pct = max(pct, 0); amountTHB = round(max(financedAmt, 0) * pct)
  - Else fall back to auto lookup
- Purity: math.Round used, clamping with max(…, 0), no logging or side effects.

Module considerations
- engines is a separate module; importing the root [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go) from engines would create a module cycle. To keep the build green without restructuring modules, the helpers accept a minimal interface (CommissionLookup). 
- *parameters.Service implements CommissionPercentByProduct, so it satisfies CommissionLookup implicitly and can be passed directly by callers in the root module.

Notes on product source
- DealState currently exposes no product field in [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go). The helpers therefore pass an empty product when falling back to auto in ResolveDealerCommissionResolved; per accessor behavior, this yields pct=0 and amountTHB=0. When callers know the product, they should compute it and call the Auto helper (or provide it when they integrate these helpers).

Build
- go build ./... at repository root: success.

Tests
- Skipped for this subtask (helpers are small and compile clean). 

No changes made to campaigns or UI.

[new_task in Code mode: 'Context
- Architecture and parameters support for CommissionPolicy are in place. Next is Todo #4: provide a reusable auto-lookup utility that converts product-based % → THB amount using current deal inputs (financed amount base).

**Assistant:**

<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>
Context
- Commission policy and domain types are in place:
  - Policy accessors in [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go)
  - DealState with DealerCommission and IDCOther in [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go)
  - Reusable calculator helpers in [engines/calculator/commission.go](engines/calculator/commission.go) including [go.declaration(): type CommissionLookup interface](engines/calculator/commission.go:12), [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionAuto(...)](engines/calculator/commission.go:19), and [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionResolved(...)](engines/calculator/commission.go:43)
- Targeting Todo #5: Update the campaigns engine to compute a per-option Dealer Commission (0 for Cash Discount) and include it in CampaignSummaries so the UI can render “Dealer Comm: THB X (Y%)” in each tile.

Scope
Modify only the engines types and campaigns package to:
1) Extend CampaignSummary with dealer commission fields.
2) Compute and populate these fields for each option in the campaigns engine.
3) Do not change pricing/cashflow/profitability or UI in this subtask.

Changes required
1) Types
   - In [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go), extend the campaign summary type used by the campaigns engine (likely CampaignSummary) with two new fields:
     - language.declaration(): DealerCommissionAmt float64 `json:"dealerCommissionAmt"`
     - language.declaration(): DealerCommissionPct float64 `json:"dealerCommissionPct"`
   - Add brief godoc stating these are computed per-option per the Dealer Commission Policy in the architecture doc; Cash Discount forced to 0.

2) Campaigns engine computation
   - In [engines/campaigns/campaigns.go](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go):
     - For each generated campaign option/row, compute dealer commission as follows:
       - If the option is “Cash Discount”:
         - DealerCommissionPct = 0
         - DealerCommissionAmt = 0
       - Else (finance options like Subdown, Subinterest, Free Insurance, Free MBSP):
         - Determine the product string to use for commission lookup:
           - Prefer deal.Product (or equivalent field on DealState). If DealState has no product field, use whatever product source is already used by campaigns to decide option rules; if none exists, leave product as "" (fallback yields 0%).
         - Determine the financed amount base:
           - Prefer an existing method/field already used by campaigns or pricing (e.g., a FinancedAmount value). If not present, compute as max(VehiclePrice - DownPayment, 0) using the fields already present in DealState. If neither are available, fallback to 0.
         - Resolve commission according to override/auto precedence:
           - If deal.DealerCommission.Mode == types.DealerCommissionModeOverride:
             - If Amt override set: DealerCommissionAmt = round(max(*Amt, 0)); DealerCommissionPct = 0
             - Else if Pct override set: DealerCommissionPct = max(*Pct, 0); DealerCommissionAmt = round(max(financedAmt, 0) * DealerCommissionPct)
             - Else: treat as auto (fall through)
           - If auto: call calculator [go.declaration(): ResolveDealerCommissionAuto(params CommissionLookup, product string, financedAmt float64)](engines/calculator/commission.go:19) to obtain pct and amount.
     - Populate the new fields on each CampaignSummary row.

3) Dependency injection for parameters access
   - To use the auto resolver, the campaigns package needs a CommissionLookup provider. Use the minimal interface already defined in [engines/calculator/commission.go](engines/calculator/commission.go:12) to avoid module cycles.
   - Wire this dependency in with the least invasive change:
     - Preferred: store a CommissionLookup on the campaigns Engine struct (or equivalent) via constructor or setter, and use it when computing summaries.
     - If there is no Engine struct and only package functions, extend the relevant function signature(s) to accept a CommissionLookup argument.
   - Do not instantiate parameters.Service inside the campaigns package.

4) Identification of “Cash Discount”
   - Use the existing campaign type/id constants or fields to detect Cash Discount rows. If the engine currently distinguishes rows by enum or string name, match on that. Add a small helper if needed to centralize this check.

5) Rounding and clamping
   - Use math.Round for amounts and clamp negatives to 0 where noted.
   - Keep numbers in THB.

6) Backward compatibility
   - If the added fields require updates to composite literals for CampaignSummary, convert to keyed literals as needed to keep the build green.
   - Do not change existing summary fields or behavior beyond adding these two new fields.

Optional tests
- If straightforward, add a small unit test exercising:
  - Cash Discount → commission 0
  - Finance option with CommissionLookup returning a fixed percent and a known financed base → amount matches rounded product
  - Override amount and override percent precedence over auto
- If test setup is heavy here, skip tests; compilation suffices for this subtask.

Acceptance criteria
- [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go) defines dealerCommissionAmt and dealerCommissionPct on the summary struct.
- [engines/campaigns/campaigns.go](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go) populates those fields:
  - Cash Discount = 0 THB (0%)
  - Finance options = computed from override/auto rules and financed base.
- CommissionLookup dependency is threaded without creating module cycles or instantiating services within campaigns.
- go build ./... at repo root succeeds.

Completion signal
- Use the attempt_completion tool with:
  - Clickable file references and the new language.declaration()s added.
  - Brief note of how CommissionLookup was injected.
  - Confirmation of build success and whether tests were added or skipped.

Constraints
- Do not modify pricing/cashflow/profitability engines or walk UI here.
- Keep changes small, idiomatic, and aligned with the architecture doc.
- These instructions supersede any general mode guidance for this subtask.</message>

**User:**

[new_task completed] Result: Implemented per-option Dealer Commission in the campaigns engine and extended types as requested. Build is green.

Summary of changes
- Types
  - Added campaign tile summary type with dealer commission fields:
    - [go.declaration(): type CampaignSummary](engines/types/types.go:259)
    - [go.declaration(): DealerCommissionAmt float64 `json:"dealerCommissionAmt"`](engines/types/types.go:265)
    - [go.declaration(): DealerCommissionPct float64 `json:"dealerCommissionPct"`](engines/types/types.go:266)
  - Brief godoc included stating these are computed per-option per the Dealer Commission Policy and Cash Discount is forced to 0.

- Campaigns engine
  - Dependency injection for commission policy percent (no module cycles):
    - [go.declaration(): type commissionLookup interface](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go:430) mirrors [go.declaration(): type CommissionLookup interface](engines/calculator/commission.go:12) so any provider exposing CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64 can be injected.
    - [go.declaration(): func (e *Engine) SetCommissionLookup(l commissionLookup) *Engine](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go:30)
  - Cash Discount identification helper:
    - [go.declaration(): func isCashDiscount(t types.CampaignType) bool](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go:435)
  - Per-option Dealer Commission computation for tile summaries:
    - [go.declaration(): func (e *Engine) GenerateCampaignSummaries(deal types.Deal, state types.DealState, campaigns []types.Campaign) []types.CampaignSummary](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go:444)
    - Behavior:
      - Cash Discount → DealerCommissionAmt=0, DealerCommissionPct=0.
      - Finance options (Subdown, Subinterest, Free Insurance, Free MBSP):
        - Financed base:
          - Prefer deal.FinancedAmount; else max(PriceExTax − DownPaymentAmount, 0).
        - Product for lookup: deal.Product (string); empty string fallback yields 0%.
        - Override/auto precedence:
          - If state.DealerCommission.Mode == override:
            - If Amt set: DealerCommissionAmt = math.Round(max(Amt, 0)); DealerCommissionPct = 0.
            - Else if Pct set: DealerCommissionPct = max(Pct, 0); DealerCommissionAmt = math.Round(max(financedBase, 0) * Pct).
            - Else: treat as auto.
          - If auto (or override without values):
            - pct = commission.CommissionPercentByProduct(product) clamped to >= 0
            - amt = math.Round(max(financedBase, 0) * pct)
        - All amounts rounded with math.Round and clamped to >= 0.
    - Notes:
      - We intentionally do not import calculator helpers here to avoid a package cycle (calculator imports campaigns). Logic matches [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionAuto(params CommissionLookup, product string, financedAmt float64)](engines/calculator/commission.go:19).

How CommissionLookup is injected
- The campaigns engine exposes a setter to inject a provider that implements CommissionPercentByProduct(product string) float64 (e.g., parameters.Service in the app layer):
  - [go.declaration(): func (e *Engine) SetCommissionLookup(l commissionLookup) *Engine](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go:30)
- This keeps campaigns decoupled from parameters and avoids instantiating services within campaigns.

Acceptance criteria check
- Types extended with dealer commission fields on summary struct:
  - See [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go) and [go.declaration(): DealerCommissionAmt float64](engines/types/types.go:265) / [go.declaration(): DealerCommissionPct float64](engines/types/types.go:266).
- Campaigns engine populates those fields:
  - Finance options computed per override/auto; Cash Discount forced to 0 → [go.declaration(): func (e *Engine) GenerateCampaignSummaries(...)](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go:444), helper [go.declaration(): func isCashDiscount(...)](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go:435).
- CommissionLookup dependency threaded without cycles and not instantiated inside campaigns:
  - [go.declaration(): type commissionLookup](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go:430), [go.declaration(): func SetCommissionLookup](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go:30).
- Build:
  - go build ./... at repo root succeeded (exit code 0).

Tests
- Tests skipped for this subtask; compilation suffices per scope.

Notes
- No changes were made to pricing, cashflow, profitability, or UI. Only [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go) and [engines/campaigns/campaigns.go](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go) were modified.

**User:**

[new_task in Code mode: 'Context
- Commission policy and domain types are in place:
  - Policy accessors in [parameters/service.go](parameters/service.go)
  - DealState with DealerCommission and IDCOther in [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go)
  - Reusable calculator helpers in [engines/calculator/commission.go](engines/calculator/commission.go) including [go.declaration(): type CommissionLookup interface](engines/calculator/commission.go:12), [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionAuto(...)](engines/calculator/commission.go:19), and [go.declaration(): func ResolveDealerCommissionResolved(...)](engines/calculator/commission.go:43)
- Targeting Todo #5: Update the campaigns engine to compute a per-option Dealer Commission (0 for Cash Discount) and include it in CampaignSummaries so the UI can render “Dealer Comm: THB X (Y%)” in each tile.

Scope
Modify only the engines types and campaigns package to:
1) Extend CampaignSummary with dealer commission fields.
2) Compute and populate these fields for each option in the campaigns engine.
3) Do not change pricing/cashflow/profitability or UI in this subtask.

Changes required
1) Types
   - In [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go), extend the campaign summary type used by the campaigns engine (likely CampaignSummary) with two new fields:
     - language.declaration(): DealerCommissionAmt float64 `json:"dealerCommissionAmt"`
     - language.declaration(): DealerCommissionPct float64 `json:"dealerCommissionPct"`
   - Add brief godoc stating these are computed per-option per the Dealer Commission Policy in the architecture doc; Cash Discount forced to 0.

2) Campaigns engine computation
   - In [engines/campaigns/campaigns.go](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go):
     - For each generated campaign option/row, compute dealer commission as follows:
       - If the option is “Cash Discount”:
         - DealerCommissionPct = 0
         - DealerCommissionAmt = 0
       - Else (finance options like Subdown, Subinterest, Free Insurance, Free MBSP):
         - Determine the product string to use for commission lookup:
           - Prefer deal.Product (or equivalent field on DealState). If DealState has no product field, use whatever product source is already used by campaigns to decide option rules; if none exists, leave product as "" (fallback yields 0%).
         - Determine the financed amount base:
           - Prefer an existing method/field already used by campaigns or pricing (e.g., a FinancedAmount value). If not present, compute as max(VehiclePrice - DownPayment, 0) using the fields already present in DealState. If neither are available, fallback to 0.
         - Resolve commission according to override/auto precedence:
           - If deal.DealerCommission.Mode == types.DealerCommissionModeOverride:
             - If Amt override set: DealerCommissionAmt = round(max(*Amt, 0)); DealerCommissionPct = 0
             - Else if Pct override set: DealerCommissionPct = max(*Pct, 0); DealerCommissionAmt = round(max(financedAmt, 0) * DealerCommissionPct)
             - Else: treat as auto (fall through)
           - If auto: call calculator [go.declaration(): ResolveDealerCommissionAuto(params CommissionLookup, product string, financedAmt float64)](engines/calculator/commission.go:19) to obtain pct and amount.
     - Populate the new fields on each CampaignSummary row.

3) Dependency injection for parameters access
   - To use the auto resolver, the campaigns package needs a CommissionLookup provider. Use the minimal interface already defined in [engines/calculator/commission.go](engines/calculator/commission.go:12) to avoid module cycles.
   - Wire this dependency in with the least invasive change:
     - Preferred: store a CommissionLookup on the campaigns Engine struct (or equivalent) via constructor or setter, and use it when computing summaries.
     - If there is no Engine struct and only package functions, extend the relevant function signature(s) to accept a CommissionLookup argument.
   - Do not instantiate parameters.Service inside the campaigns package.

4) Identification of “Cash Discount”
   - Use the existing campaign type/id constants or fields to detect Cash Discount rows. If the engine currently distinguishes rows by enum or string name, match on that. Add a small helper if needed to centralize this check.

5) Rounding and clamping
   - Use math.Round for amounts and clamp negatives to 0 where noted.
   - Keep numbers in THB.

6) Backward compatibility
   - If the added fields require updates to composite literals for CampaignSummary, convert to keyed literals as needed to keep the build green.
   - Do not change existing summary fields or behavior beyond adding these two new fields.

Optional tests
- If straightforward, add a small unit test exercising:
  - Cash Discount → commission 0
  - Finance option with CommissionLookup returning a fixed percent and a known financed base → amount matches rounded product
  - Override amount and override percent precedence over auto
- If test setup is heavy here, skip tests; compilation suffices for this subtask.

Acceptance criteria
- [engines/types/types.go](engines/types/types.go) defines dealerCommissionAmt and dealerCommissionPct on the summary struct.
- [engines/campaigns/campaigns.go](engines/campaigns/campaigns.go) populates those fields:
  - Cash Discount = 0 THB (0%)
  - Finance options = computed from override/auto rules and financed base.
- CommissionLookup dependency is threaded without creating module cycles or instantiating services within campaigns.
- go build ./... at repo root succeeds.

Completion signal
- Use the attempt_completion tool with:
  - Clickable file references and the new language.declaration()s added.
  - Brief note of how CommissionLookup was injected.
  - Confirmation of build success and whether tests were added or skipped.

Constraints
- Do not modify pricing/cashflow/profitability engines or walk UI here.
- Keep changes small, idiomatic, and aligned with the architecture doc.
- These instructions supersede any general mode guidance for this subtask.'] Result:

<mode>code</mode>
<message>
Context
- Redesign specs are in [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md) and engine groundwork is done (parameters, domain types, commission computations).
- Targeting Todo #6 (Walk UI Phase 1 - Structure): Add the new UI structure without wiring logic yet. No business logic; just visible, layout-correct controls and panes. Radio selection can be approximated by single-row selection for now.

Scope
Modify the Walk desktop UI under walk/ to:
- Add the “Subsidy budget” input and IDCs section (Dealer Commissions pill + IDCs - Other input).
- Replace/ensure campaign options are presented in a grid-like list control using single selection (radio-like).
- Add a bottom splitter region containing “Campaign Details” and “Key Metrics & Summary” panes.
- Keep all new controls un-wired (placeholders) to be connected in Phase 2.

Where to change
- Update the main window setup in [walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go). Match the existing construction style (declarative or imperative).
- If there is a central UI builder, extend it accordingly; otherwise, refactor lightly to keep code readable.

Required structure and controls
1) Product & Subsidy section (top)
   - Place above the campaign grid in a Composite/GroupBox with a clear caption.
   - Add controls:
     - Subsidy budget (THB):
       - A numeric input (prefer walk.NumberEdit if used elsewhere) named subsidyBudgetEd.
       - Initial placeholder 0; right-aligned text; unit shown in label.
       - Add label: “Subsidy budget (THB):”
     - IDCs - Dealer Commissions pill:
       - A flat-style button (or link-style) named dealerCommissionPill showing: “IDCs - Dealer Commissions: auto”
       - Disabled in Phase 1 (wiring comes later); tooltip “Auto-calculated from product policy; click to override (Phase 2)”.
     - IDCs - Other:
       - A numeric input named idcOtherEd, initial 0.
       - Label: “IDCs - Other (THB):”
     - Rate mode controls (if already present), keep as-is. Do not remove any existing product/term/timing inputs.
   - Optional helpers you may define to keep main tidy:
     - [go.declaration(): func buildProductAndSubsidySection(parent walk.Container) (ui struct{ Subsidy *walk.NumberEdit; DealerPill *walk.PushButton; Other *walk.NumberEdit }, err error)](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go:1)

2) Campaign Options (grid)
   - Present a grid using TableView or ListView based on current code style; prefer TableView with single-row selection to simulate “radio.”
   - Columns (match text and order; wiring can be placeholders/dummy bindings):
     - Select (visual indicator only for now; selection state reflects as filled/empty circle or leave blank until Phase 2)
     - Campaign
     - Monthly Installment (with “(eff …%)” in the text if easy; otherwise, just “Monthly” placeholder)
     - Downpayment
     - Subsidy / Acq.RoRAC
     - Notes
   - Single selection must be enabled; multi-select disabled.
   - Use an existing view model if present; otherwise, create a minimal in-memory model with 3–5 static rows so visual layout is verifiable in Phase 1 (these rows are placeholders only).
   - If you implement a helper, keep it local:
     - [go.declaration(): func buildCampaignOptionsView(parent walk.Container) (*walk.TableView, error)](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go:1)

3) Bottom splitter: Campaign Details | Key Metrics & Summary
   - Add a horizontal splitter under the grid with two group boxes:
     - Left: “Campaign Details” containing placeholder labels/readonly edits that will later show contextual parameters.
     - Right: “Key Metrics & Summary” with placeholder labels/readonly edits: “Monthly Installment”, “Nominal Customer Rate”, “Effective Rate”, “Financed Amount”, “Acquisition RoRAC”, “IDC Total”, “IDC - Dealer Comm.”, “IDC - Other”, “Parameter Version”, “Calc Time”.
   - Both panes are static placeholders in Phase 1; no recompute on selection yet.
   - Optional helper:
     - [go.declaration(): func buildDetailsAndMetricsSplitter(parent walk.Container) (left, right *walk.GroupBox, err error)](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go:1)

4) Layout and UX polish (structure only)
   - Use margins and stretch factors so the grid expands with the window; the splitter panes share space evenly.
   - Ensure tab order is sensible (budget, other IDC, then grid).
   - Do not add runtime dependencies beyond walk/declarative that are already in use.

Non-goals for this subtask (defer to Phase 2+)
- No binding to live DealState.
- No handling of Dealer Commission auto/override behavior; the pill is a disabled placeholder.
- No real data in the grid; placeholder rows are acceptable.
- No prompts for replacing IDCs - Other when campaign changes.

Acceptance criteria
- The app builds and starts; the main window shows:
  - Top “Product & Subsidy” area with:
    - “Subsidy budget (THB)” numeric input,
    - a disabled “IDCs - Dealer Commissions: auto” pill,
    - “IDCs - Other (THB)” numeric input.
  - A Campaign Options grid with the specified columns and single selection.
  - A bottom horizontal splitter with “Campaign Details” on the left and “Key Metrics & Summary” on the right (placeholders).
- No wiring or validations are required yet.

Completion signal
- Use attempt_completion to report:
  - Files changed (clickable links to [walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go) and any new helpers).
  - Any added language.declaration() helper functions or struct fields (clickable).
  - Confirmation that go build ./... succeeded and that the app runs showing the new sections.
  - Note any small structural refactors done to keep main.go readable (e.g., extracted builder functions).

Notes
- Keep edits minimal and idiomatic. Reuse existing patterns (declarative vs imperative) already present in [walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go).
- These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general mode guidance for this subtask.
