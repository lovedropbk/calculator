hi, please continue working on below task: 

Context
- Redesign specs are in [docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md](docs/financial-calculator-ui-redesign.md) and engine groundwork is done (parameters, domain types, commission computations).
- Targeting Todo #6 (Walk UI Phase 1 - Structure): Add the new UI structure without wiring logic yet. No business logic; just visible, layout-correct controls and panes. Radio selection can be approximated by single-row selection for now.

Scope
Modify the Walk desktop UI under walk/ to:
- Add the “Subsidy budget” input and IDCs section (Dealer Commissions pill + IDCs - Other input).
- Replace/ensure campaign options are presented in a grid-like list control using single selection (radio-like).
- Add a bottom splitter region containing “Campaign Details” and “Key Metrics & Summary” panes.
- Keep all new controls un-wired (placeholders) to be connected in Phase 2.

Where to change
- Update the main window setup in [walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go). Match the existing construction style (declarative or imperative).
- If there is a central UI builder, extend it accordingly; otherwise, refactor lightly to keep code readable.

Required structure and controls
1) Product & Subsidy section (top)
   - Place above the campaign grid in a Composite/GroupBox with a clear caption.
   - Add controls:
     - Subsidy budget (THB):
       - A numeric input (prefer walk.NumberEdit if used elsewhere) named subsidyBudgetEd.
       - Initial placeholder 0; right-aligned text; unit shown in label.
       - Add label: “Subsidy budget (THB):”
     - IDCs - Dealer Commissions pill:
       - A flat-style button (or link-style) named dealerCommissionPill showing: “IDCs - Dealer Commissions: auto”
       - Disabled in Phase 1 (wiring comes later); tooltip “Auto-calculated from product policy; click to override (Phase 2)”.
     - IDCs - Other:
       - A numeric input named idcOtherEd, initial 0.
       - Label: “IDCs - Other (THB):”
     - Rate mode controls (if already present), keep as-is. Do not remove any existing product/term/timing inputs.
   - Optional helpers you may define to keep main tidy:
     - [go.declaration(): func buildProductAndSubsidySection(parent walk.Container) (ui struct{ Subsidy *walk.NumberEdit; DealerPill *walk.PushButton; Other *walk.NumberEdit }, err error)](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go:1)

2) Campaign Options (grid)
   - Present a grid using TableView or ListView based on current code style; prefer TableView with single-row selection to simulate “radio.”
   - Columns (match text and order; wiring can be placeholders/dummy bindings):
     - Select (visual indicator only for now; selection state reflects as filled/empty circle or leave blank until Phase 2)
     - Campaign
     - Monthly Installment (with “(eff …%)” in the text if easy; otherwise, just “Monthly” placeholder)
     - Downpayment
     - Subsidy / Acq.RoRAC
     - Notes
   - Single selection must be enabled; multi-select disabled.
   - Use an existing view model if present; otherwise, create a minimal in-memory model with 3–5 static rows so visual layout is verifiable in Phase 1 (these rows are placeholders only).
   - If you implement a helper, keep it local:
     - [go.declaration(): func buildCampaignOptionsView(parent walk.Container) (*walk.TableView, error)](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go:1)

3) Bottom splitter: Campaign Details | Key Metrics & Summary
   - Add a horizontal splitter under the grid with two group boxes:
     - Left: “Campaign Details” containing placeholder labels/readonly edits that will later show contextual parameters.
     - Right: “Key Metrics & Summary” with placeholder labels/readonly edits: “Monthly Installment”, “Nominal Customer Rate”, “Effective Rate”, “Financed Amount”, “Acquisition RoRAC”, “IDC Total”, “IDC - Dealer Comm.”, “IDC - Other”, “Parameter Version”, “Calc Time”.
   - Both panes are static placeholders in Phase 1; no recompute on selection yet.
   - Optional helper:
     - [go.declaration(): func buildDetailsAndMetricsSplitter(parent walk.Container) (left, right *walk.GroupBox, err error)](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go:1)

4) Layout and UX polish (structure only)
   - Use margins and stretch factors so the grid expands with the window; the splitter panes share space evenly.
   - Ensure tab order is sensible (budget, other IDC, then grid).
   - Do not add runtime dependencies beyond walk/declarative that are already in use.

Non-goals for this subtask (defer to Phase 2+)
- No binding to live DealState.
- No handling of Dealer Commission auto/override behavior; the pill is a disabled placeholder.
- No real data in the grid; placeholder rows are acceptable.
- No prompts for replacing IDCs - Other when campaign changes.

Acceptance criteria
- The app builds and starts; the main window shows:
  - Top “Product & Subsidy” area with:
    - “Subsidy budget (THB)” numeric input,
    - a disabled “IDCs - Dealer Commissions: auto” pill,
    - “IDCs - Other (THB)” numeric input.
  - A Campaign Options grid with the specified columns and single selection.
  - A bottom horizontal splitter with “Campaign Details” on the left and “Key Metrics & Summary” on the right (placeholders).
- No wiring or validations are required yet.

Completion signal
- Use attempt_completion to report:
  - Files changed (clickable links to [walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go) and any new helpers).
  - Any added language.declaration() helper functions or struct fields (clickable).
  - Confirmation that go build ./... succeeded and that the app runs showing the new sections.
  - Note any small structural refactors done to keep main.go readable (e.g., extracted builder functions).

Notes
- Keep edits minimal and idiomatic. Reuse existing patterns (declarative vs imperative) already present in [walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go](walk/cmd/fc-walk/main.go).
- These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general mode guidance for this subtask.
