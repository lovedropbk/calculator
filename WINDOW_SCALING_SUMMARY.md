# Window Scaling & Resizing - Implementation Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation Date
2024

### Problem Solved
The application had severe scaling and resizing issues:
- UI elements too small on high-DPI displays
- Window couldn't resize properly
- No adaptation to different screen sizes
- Window state not saved between sessions
- Poor multi-monitor support

### Solution Delivered
Comprehensive 7-phase DPI-aware responsive window scaling system.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: DPI Awareness
- Automatic DPI detection (96, 120, 144, 192 DPI)
- All UI elements scale proportionally
- Per-monitor DPI support
- Scale factor calculations

### ✅ Phase 2: Responsive Layouts
- Three layout modes: Compact, Normal, Wide
- Breakpoint-based column width adaptation
- Column hiding in compact mode
- Proportional + minimum width system

### ✅ Phase 3: Dynamic Window Sizing
- Improved initial size calculation (DPI-aware)
- Lowered MinSize: 900×600 (from 1100×700)
- Added MaxSize: 2400×1600
- 90% screen coverage max
- Content-based sizing

### ✅ Phase 4: Comprehensive Event Handlers
- SizeChanged: layout mode detection + column updates
- Closing: state save + unsaved data prompt
- DPI change detection
- Debounced state saving

### ✅ Phase 5: Window State Persistence
- JSON-based state file
- DPI-adjusted restoration
- Position validation (prevents off-screen)
- Maximized state preservation
- Location: `%USERPROFILE%\.financial-calculator\window_state.json`

### ✅ Phase 6: Multi-Monitor Support
- Per-monitor DPI detection
- Work area calculation per monitor
- Window position validation
- Drag-between-monitors handling
- Monitor disconnect handling
