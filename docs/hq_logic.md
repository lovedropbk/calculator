Let's focus on the fundamental building blocks of the Acquisition RORAC: the cash flow generation, the calculation of the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and the precise handling and amortization of Initial Direct Costs (IDCs) and Subsidies. We will ignore all credit risk (PD, LGD, CoR) and cost of funding (CoF, MFR, MFS) elements for this deep dive, concentrating on replicating the core deal mechanics.
The primary subroutines and functions involved are:
prcStartCalculation (in mdlMain.bas): Orchestrates the entire process.
fctCash_Flow_Generation (in mdlCash_Flow_Generation.bas): Creates the detailed cash flow profile.
sub_CalcCF (in Library_Cashflow.bas): Calculates the IRR and Net Book Value (NBV) runoff.
mdlLGD_Generation.bas and fctAmortization_IDC_Subsidies (in mdlLGD_Functions.bas): Used to track the amortization of IDCs/Subsidies.
1. Overall Inputs for Cash Flow and IRR (Standard MBPC)
These inputs are crucial for defining the financial product and will be sourced from your equivalent of the "New Input Mask" and "Index" sheets.
dblSales_Price: The vehicle's sales price.
dblAdditional_Financed_Items: Any additional items included in the financing.
dblDown_Payment: Customer's downpayment.
dblInititial_Direct_Cost ([IDC]): Costs incurred by the financing entity at inception (e.g., commissions).
dblSubsidies ([Subsidies]): Subsidies paid or received by the entity at inception (e.g., manufacturer incentives).
dblcontracted_RV ([Cont_RV]): Contracted Residual Value or Balloon payment at maturity.
intPayment_Frequency: How often payments are made, in months (e.g., 1 for monthly, 3 for quarterly).
strPayment_Mode: "In Arrears" (payments at end of period) or "In Advance" (payments at start of period).
strInterest_Type: "Fix" or "Variable" interest rate.
datePayout_Date: The date the deal is disbursed (contract starts).
intCredit_Term ([Maturity]): The total term of the contract in months.
intRepricing_Term: For strInterest_Type = "Variable", the period in months after which the interest rate can be repriced. For this scope, it behaves like intCredit_Term if not focusing on repricing logic.
intInterest_Only_Period: Number of months for which only interest is paid (at the beginning of the contract).
dateFirst_Instalment_Date_Input: An optional user-specified first installment date. If empty, it's derived.
dblNOM_CR ([NOM_CR]): The Nominal Customer Rate (e.g., 5.0 for 5%). This is a crucial rate for cash flow calculation.
dblLast_Instalment: A flag, "yes" or "no", indicating if the RV/Balloon payment is part of the "last installment" calculation.
[Manual_CF_Flag]: Flag indicating if a manual cash flow schedule is used ("1" for Yes, "0" for No).
[Accelerated_Payment_Flag]: Flag for activating an accelerated payment feature ("1" for Yes, "0" for No).
[Start_Value_Acc_Payment], [Accelerated_Payment_End], [Periods_Acc_Payments]: Parameters for accelerated payment.
2. Core Cash Flow Generation Logic (fctCash_Flow_Generation)
This function constructs the primary cash flow schedule (arrCash_Flow_Generation) which represents the entity's perspective for IRR calculation, meaning it includes IDCs and Subsidies as upfront cash flows.
2.1. Initial Financed Amount (NAF)
dblNAF = dblSales_Price + dblAdditional_Financed_Items - dblDown_Payment
2.2. Determining Cash Flow Dates and Period Counters
The arrCash_Flow_Generation array is built iteratively, typically for each payment period.
arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 0): Cash Flow Date
arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 1): Period Counter (excl. Grace Period)
arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 2): Period Counter (incl. Grace Period)
Steps:
First Period (i=0, j=0):
arrCash_Flow_Generation(0, 0) = datePayout_Date
arrCash_Flow_Generation(0, 1) = 0
arrCash_Flow_Generation(0, 2) = 0
arrCash_Flow_Generation(0, 4) (Irregular Instalment) = -dblNAF.
arrCash_Flow_Generation(0, 11) (Total Cash Flow incl. IDC/Subs) = -dblNAF - dblInititial_Direct_Cost + dblSubsidies. (This is the critical cash flow for the entity's IRR at time 0).
Subsequent Periods (i > 0, j > 0):
dateCash_Flow_Date_Pre_Period = arrCash_Flow_Generation(j-1, 0)
arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 0) (Current Cash Flow Date): Determined by fctCash_Flow_Date (see 2.3 below).
arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 1) (Period Counter excl. Grace): Determined by fctPeriod_Counter_excl_Grace_Period.
arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 2) (Period Counter incl. Grace): Determined by fctPeriod_Counter_incl_Grace_Period using intInterest_Only_Period.
2.3. fctCash_Flow_Date(intPayment_Frequency, dateCash_Flow_Date_Pre_Period, dateFirst_Instalment_Date, arrSkip_Months())
This function determines the next payment date.
dateFirst_Instalment_Date:
If dateFirst_Instalment_Date_Input is provided, dateFirst_Instalment_Date = dateFirst_Instalment_Date_Input.
Otherwise, dateFirst_Instalment_Date = DateAdd("m", intPayment_Frequency, datePayout_Date + 1) - 1.
Logic:
If dateFirst_Instalment_Date is later than the system-calculated next payment date (DateAdd("m", intPayment_Frequency, dateCash_Flow_Date_Pre_Period + 1) - 1), then dateFirst_Instalment_Date is used. This allows for a delayed first payment.
Otherwise, the date is simply DateAdd("m", intPayment_Frequency, dateCash_Flow_Date_Pre_Period + 1) - 1.
February/Month-End Handling: If [Date_Case] = "yes" (a flag typically tied to specific country needs for consistent month-end dates), the function adjusts February dates to 28/29 and other months to the day of datePayout_Date ([Day_Payout]). Otherwise, DateAdd handles month-end rollovers correctly (e.g., Jan 31 + 1 month = Feb 28/29).
arrSkip_Months() logic is not active for MBPC.
2.4. Calculating Regular and Irregular Payments (for Entity's Cash Flow)
Irregular Instalment (arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 4)):
For i=0, it's -dblNAF.
For the last payment period (defined by intCredit_Term): it's dblcontracted_RV.
Otherwise, 0.
Manual CF / Accelerated Payments: If [Manual_CF_Flag] = 1 or [Accelerated_Payment_Flag] = 1, these values are read directly from arrMan_Cash_Flow (which is populated from "Manual_Cash_Flows" sheet or generated iteratively for accelerated payments).
Irregular Interest (arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 5)):
Applies only during intInterest_Only_Period.
For "In Arrears": dblNAF * dblNOM_CR * fct_DiffDays30(previous_date, current_date) / 360.
For "In Advance": (dblNAF * dblNOM_CR * fct_DiffDays30(current_date, next_date) / 360) / (1 + dblNOM_CR * fct_DiffDays30(current_date, next_date) / 360).
If [Manual_CF_Flag] = 1 and an "Interest Only" period is indicated in the manual CF: lContract.LiqRunoff(i).NBV * lContract.IRR * fct_DiffDays30(previous_date, current_date) / 360. This requires an iterative calculation (see 2.6).
Regular Payment (dblRegular_Payment): This is the constant installment amount calculated to amortize the NAF over intCredit_Term at dblNOM_CR, considering irregular payments.
It's derived from the formula: dblRegular_Payment = dblZaehler / -dblNenner.
dblZaehler = Sum (Factor * (Irregular_Instalment + Irregular_Interest)).
dblNenner = Sum (Factor * Regular_Payment_Flag).
The Factor here is arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 3) (discount factor based on dblNOM_CR).
Regular_Payment_Flag is 1 if a regular payment is due, 0 otherwise (derived from fctRegular_Payment_Excl_Payment_Mode and fctRegular_Payment_Incl_Payment_Mode).
Regular Payments (arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 9)): Regular_Payment_Flag * dblRegular_Payment.
Total Cash Flow Excl. IDC/Subs (arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 10)):
Irregular_Instalment + Irregular_Interest + Regular_Payments.
Total Cash Flow Incl. IDC/Subs (arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 11)):
For i=0: arrCash_Flow_Generation(0, 10) - dblInititial_Direct_Cost + dblSubsidies.
For i>0: arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 10).
2.5. fct_DiffDays30(date1, date2)
A helper function to calculate the number of days between two dates using the 30/360 day count convention. This is critical for accurate interest calculations.
lintDays = Day(date2) - IIf(Day(date1) < 30, Day(date1), 30) - IIf(Day(date1) - 29 > 0, IIf(Day(date2) - 30 < 0, 0, Day(date2) - 30), 0)
fct_DiffDays30 = (Year(date2) - Year(date1)) * 360 + (Month(date2) - Month(date1)) * 30 + lintDays
2.6. Iteration for Manual Cash Flow / Accelerated Payments
Manual Cash Flow ("Interest Only" periods): If [Manual_CF_Flag] = 1 and the manual cash flow indicates "Interest Only" periods not at the beginning, fctCash_Flow_Generation will call sub_CalcCF to get an intermediate lContract.IRR and lContract.LiqRunoff.NBV. It then re-runs fctCash_Flow_Generation (via a GoTo Iteration) using these intermediate NBVs to correctly calculate arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 5) (Irregular Interest). This is effectively a nested iteration to ensure accurate interest calculation for non-standard interest-only periods.
Accelerated Payments ([Accelerated_Payment_Flag] = 1): An outer iteration in prcStartCalculation adjusts dblAccPayment. fctCash_Flow_Generation is called repeatedly until the lContract.LiqRunoff.NBV at [Accelerated_Payment_End] matches the target [end_value_acc_payment].
3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Calculation (sub_CalcCF)
The sub_CalcCF subroutine (in Library_Cashflow.bas) is called by prcStartCalculation and takes the fully constructed cash flow (arrCF, derived from arrCash_Flow_Generation with IDCs/Subsidies at t=0) to compute the entity's IRR.
3.1. typCashflow Structure
The arrCF (which is arrcash_flow_results from fctCash_Flow_Generation) is converted into a typCashflow object (lCFProfile) for IRR calculation.
lCFProfile.a(lintRun).Date: Cash flow date.
lCFProfile.a(lintRun).CashFlow: The total cash flow for the period.
For i=0 (datePayout_Date), lCFProfile.a(1).CashFlow is the initial cash outlay to the entity: -(NAF + IDC - Subsidies).
For i>0, it's the Total Cash Flow incl. IDC/Subs from fctCash_Flow_Generation.
lCFProfile.Eps: A small tolerance value (e.g., 0.0001) for the iteration.
3.2. fct_IRR(CF as typCashflow, pstrConv as String)
This is the main function to trigger the IRR calculation.
pstrConv: Day count convention, typically "30/360".
Initialization (sub_CFInit): Sets initial NBV for the first period (CF.a(1).NBVnom = -CF.a(1).CashFlow) and calculates Diff (years between cash flows) using fct_DiffYears.
Nominal IRR (fct_IRRNom): The core of the IRR calculation, using the Newton-Raphson method.
It iteratively searches for a CF.IRnom (the nominal IRR) such that the final NBVnom (Net Book Value nominal) in the cash flow profile is very close to zero (within CF.Eps).
Iteration steps:
Start with an initial guess for CF.IRnom (usually 0).
For each cash flow period:
ldblFactor = (1 + CF.IRnom * .Diff)
NBVnom(current) = NBVnom(previous) * ldblFactor - .CashFlow(current)
Calculate ldblDerivative (the derivative of the final NBV with respect to CF.IRnom) to determine the direction and magnitude of the next guess.
Update CF.IRnom = CF.IRnom - (Final_NBV_Nom * Prod_Factor) / Derivative.
Repeat until Abs(Final_NBV_Nom) < CF.Eps or maximum iterations reached (e.g., 40).
Effective IRR (fct_IRREff): Similar iterative method to fct_IRRNom but uses effective compounding: ldblFactor = (1 + CF.IReff) ^ .Diff. For this scope, the nominal IRR is the primary focus and is stored as pContract.IRR.
Output: pContract.IRR stores the calculated nominal IRR of the deal. pContract.LiqRunoff is populated with lCFProfile.a(lintRun).NBVnom values, representing the outstanding NBV for the entity at each cash flow date.
3.3. fct_DiffYears(pdblFrom, pdblTo, pstrConv)
This function calculates the time difference in years based on the specified day count convention (pstrConv). For our purposes, "30/360" is the standard for cash flow.
fct_DiffYears = fct_DiffDays30(pdblFrom, pdblTo) / 360
4. IDC and Subsidies Handling and Amortization ([IDC_periodic])
IDCs and Subsidies represent upfront cash flows for the entity that impact the entity's IRR. However, for RORAC calculation, the impact needs to be distributed over the life of the asset.
4.1. Inclusion in Entity IRR Cash Flow (at T=0)
As seen in 2.2, dblInititial_Direct_Cost is subtracted and dblSubsidies are added to the initial NAF in arrCash_Flow_Generation(0, 11) (and thus lCFProfile.a(1).CashFlow) before the IRR is calculated. This ensures the computed pContract.IRR reflects the profitability from the entity's perspective, considering these upfront costs/benefits.
4.2. Customer-Facing NBV (arrNew_Credit_Runoff)
To correctly amortize IDCs/Subsidies, we need to know the customer's principal outstanding, excluding the impact of these initial items.
Temporary Cash Flow Adjustment: If dblInititial_Direct_Cost - dblSubsidies <> 0:
arrCF(0, 2) (the initial entity cash flow) is temporarily adjusted back by + dblInititial_Direct_Cost - dblSubsidies. This effectively creates a cash flow profile as if IDCs/Subsidies were never part of the initial outlay.
Recalculate Runoff: sub_CalcCF is called again with this adjusted arrCF. This generates a lContract.LiqRunoff that represents the customer's true principal runoff (arrNew_Credit_Runoff).
Restore Cash Flow: arrCF(0, 2) is then adjusted back to its original value (- dblInititial_Direct_Cost + dblSubsidies) to ensure the primary lContract object holds the entity's perspective.
4.3. Amortization Logic (mdlLGD_Generation.bas and fctAmortization_IDC_Subsidies)
The [IDC_periodic] component for the RORAC numerator represents the amortized portion of these net initial costs/benefits. This is tracked in arrLGD_Generation(j, 3) (labelled "Amortization IDC/Subsidies" but actually representing the unamortized balance for previous periods and then the amortization step itself, confusingly).
A clearer way to think about [IDC_periodic] is how it's calculated on the Index sheet, which relies on the difference between the actual NBV (entity's perspective) and the customer-facing NBV (arrNew_Credit_Runoff).
The unamortized balance of IDC/Subsidies at any given period j (arrLGD_Generation(j, 3) in the code) is derived by comparing the lContract.LiqRunoff(j+1).NBV (entity's NBV which includes the IDC/Subsidies effect) with arrNew_Credit_Runoff(j+1) (customer's NBV).
At j=0, arrLGD_Generation(0, 3) will be dblInititial_Direct_Cost - dblSubsidies.
For j > 0, arrLGD_Generation(j, 3) (unamortized balance for the next period) is lContract.LiqRunoff(j+1).NBV - arrNew_Credit_Runoff(j+1).
The periodic amortization ([IDC_periodic] in the RORAC formula) represents the portion of these net initial costs/benefits that is recognized in a given period. This value is typically calculated on the "Index" sheet after all cash flows and runoffs are finalized. It's essentially the amortized amount of dblInititial_Direct_Cost - dblSubsidies over the life of the deal, proportional to the NBV runoff, or in some simplified cases, a straight-line amortization.
In the original RORAC formula: [IDC_periodic] is derived from IDC_periodic_margin. A common approach is:
IDC_periodic_margin = (Initial_IDC_Net / PV_Outstanding) / Effective_Maturity_Years or spread over all cash flows.
The code itself has a fctAmortization_IDC_Subsidies function, but it's used to calculate the unamortized amount from a previous period, or the total initial amount. The actual [IDC_periodic] in the RORAC formula would be derived from the overall IDC_Net and the resulting IRR / runoff.
To replicate the [IDC_periodic] in the RORAC formula for MBPC, if not using a complex formula on the Index sheet, a simplified approach could be:
Calculate Net_IDC = dblInititial_Direct_Cost - dblSubsidies.
The [IDC_periodic] would be Net_IDC / intCredit_Term (for monthly periods) or Net_IDC / (intCredit_Term / 12) (for an annual rate if intCredit_Term is in months).
However, the code's [IDC_periodic] is likely a rate derived from a PV calculation. The most robust replication would involve taking Net_IDC (or the equivalent PV of this stream) and dividing it by dblPV_Outstanding to get a ratio for the RORAC formula.
5. Replication Steps for Another LLM
Here's a step-by-step guide for another LLM to implement these core components:
A. Define Inputs and Data Structures:
Inputs: Collect all inputs listed in Section 1 ("Overall Inputs").
CashFlowEntry Structure: Create a data structure to hold periodic cash flow details:
code
Code
struct CashFlowEntry {
    int periodCounterExclGrace; // Period Counter excl Grace Period
    DateTime cashFlowDate;      // Cash Flow Date
    double entityCashFlow;      // Total Cash Flow incl. IDC/Subs (for IRR)
    double regularPaymentFlag;  // 1 if regular payment due, 0 otherwise
    double irregularInstallment; // Irregular Installment (RV, NAF, EO)
    double irregularInterest;   // Irregular Interest (during interest-only)
    double principalOnlyFactor; // Special factor for principal only (0 or 1)
    double entityNBV;           // Entity's Net Book Value (NBV)
    double customerNBV;         // Customer's Net Book Value (NBV)
};
```3.  **`ContractResults` Structure:** To store outputs:
struct ContractResults {
double irr;
std::vector<CashFlowEntry> cashFlowSchedule;
double amortizedIDC_Periodic; // The [IDC_periodic] component
};
code
Code
B. Implement Helper Functions:
fct_DiffDays30(date1, date2): Calculate days between dates using 30/360.
fctCash_Flow_Date(intPayment_Frequency, previousDate, firstInstallmentDateInput, payoutDate): Determine next cash flow date (excluding "skip months" logic).
fctPeriod_Counter_excl_Grace_Period(previousCFDate, currentCFDate, firstInstallmentDate, previousPeriodCounter, paymentFrequency): Increment period counter.
fctPeriod_Counter_incl_Grace_Period(periodCounterExclGrace, interestOnlyPeriod): Adjust for interest-only periods.
C. Implement calculateCashFlowSchedule(inputs) Function (Analogous to fctCash_Flow_Generation)
This function will generate the initial CashFlowEntry vector for the entity's IRR calculation.
Initialization (t=0):
CashFlowEntry[0].cashFlowDate = inputs.payoutDate
CashFlowEntry[0].entityCashFlow = -(inputs.dblNAF + inputs.dblInititial_Direct_Cost - inputs.dblSubsidies)
Initialize other fields as appropriate.
Iterate t=1 to intCredit_Term (or intArray_Limit for manual CF):
Determine currentCashFlowDate using fctCash_Flow_Date.
Determine periodCounterExclGrace and periodCounterInclGrace.
Irregular Instalment:
If currentPeriodCounterExclGrace == inputs.intCredit_Term (or equivalent last period condition): inputs.dblcontracted_RV.
Else: 0.
If inputs.manualCFFlag == 1 or inputs.acceleratedPaymentFlag == 1: Overwrite with values from manual/accelerated schedule.
Irregular Interest:
If periodCounterExclGrace is within intInterest_Only_Period: Calculate based on inputs.dblNAF or prior NBV and inputs.dblNOM_CR.
If inputs.manualCFFlag == 1 and manual CF type is "Interest Only": Calculate based on estimated NBV from prior iteration (requires iterative outer loop in calculateContractResults).
Regular Payment Flag: Determine if a regular payment is due based on strPayment_Mode, intCredit_Term, intInterest_Only_Period, dblLast_Instalment.
Calculate dblRegular_Payment: This is the constant installment that equates NPV of future cash flows to zero. This requires an internal "goal-seek" for dblRegular_Payment on (Irregular_Instalment + Irregular_Interest + Regular_Payment_Flag * dblRegular_Payment) discounted by dblNOM_CR.
Regular Payments: Regular_Payment_Flag * dblRegular_Payment.
Total Cash Flow (for entity IRR): Irregular_Instalment + Irregular_Interest + Regular_Payments.
Store all components in CashFlowEntry for the current period.
Handle Manual CF and Accelerated Payments: If flags are set, override calculations with data from the respective schedules. An outer iterative loop might be needed for [Accelerated_Payment_Flag] or "Interest Only" periods in manual CF.
D. Implement calculateIRR(cashFlowEntries) Function (Analogous to fct_IRRNom within fct_IRR)
This function will compute the nominal IRR for a given set of CashFlowEntry.
Input: A vector of CashFlowEntry where CashFlowEntry.entityCashFlow holds the relevant cash flows (including IDC/Subsidies at t=0).
Newton-Raphson Iteration:
Initial Guess: irrGuess = 0.05 (or any reasonable starting point).
Loop (e.g., 40 iterations or until convergence):
Initialize currentNBV = -cashFlowEntries[0].entityCashFlow.
Initialize derivative = 0.0.
factorProduct = 1.0.
For t=1 to last_period:
diffYears = fct_DiffYears(cashFlowEntries[t-1].cashFlowDate, cashFlowEntries[t].cashFlowDate, "30/360").
discountFactor = (1 + irrGuess * diffYears).
currentNBV = currentNBV * discountFactor - cashFlowEntries[t].entityCashFlow.
factorProduct = factorProduct / discountFactor.
derivative = derivative + cashFlowEntries[t].entityCashFlow * factorProduct * (diffYears / (1 + irrGuess * diffYears)). (This is a simplified derivative, refer to fct_IRRNom for exact formulation).
finalNBV = currentNBV.
If Abs(finalNBV) < tolerance (e.g., 1e-5): Break loop, IRR = irrGuess.
Update irrGuess = irrGuess - (finalNBV * factorProduct) / derivative.
Handle irrGuess < -1 (set to 0) to prevent divergence.
Output: The converged irrGuess as the nominal IRR. Also, populate CashFlowEntry.entityNBV during the final successful iteration.
E. Implement calculateContractResults(inputs) Function (Analogous to prcStartCalculation orchestration)
This function coordinates the entire process to get the final ContractResults.
Generate Entity Cash Flow: Call calculateCashFlowSchedule(inputs) to get entityCashFlowSchedule.
Calculate Entity IRR: Call calculateIRR(entityCashFlowSchedule) to get entityIRR and entityNBVs. Store entityIRR in ContractResults.irr.
Calculate Customer-Facing NBV (arrNew_Credit_Runoff equivalent):
If (inputs.dblInititial_Direct_Cost - inputs.dblSubsidies) != 0:
Create a temporary customerCashFlowSchedule by adjusting entityCashFlowSchedule[0].entityCashFlow by +(inputs.dblInititial_Direct_Cost - inputs.dblSubsidies).
Call calculateIRR(customerCashFlowSchedule) to re-calculate NBVs. Store these NBVs as CashFlowEntry.customerNBV in your ContractResults.cashFlowSchedule.
Else (IDC - Subsidies == 0): CashFlowEntry.customerNBV can just be CashFlowEntry.entityNBV.
Calculate [IDC_periodic]:
This represents the effective periodic rate impact of Net_IDC = inputs.dblInititial_Direct_Cost - inputs.dblSubsidies.
One common approximation in RORAC tools is a rate applied to the outstanding balance.
From the code's context, [IDC_periodic] is a pre-calculated value or derived from other sheet formulas, not directly from fctAmortization_IDC_Subsidies.
Replication Strategy: A simple approximation for [IDC_periodic] as a rate in the RORAC formula could be (Net_IDC / inputs.dblNAF) / inputs.intCredit_Term * 12 (if expressed as an annual percentage) or more precisely by annualizing the PV of the Net_IDC stream across the dblPV_Outstanding.
Most Direct from Code's Intent: The amortization is implicitly handled on the Index sheet or via arrLGD_Generation(j, 3). If [IDC_periodic] on the Index sheet is a constant annual rate, you might simply use Net_IDC / (Total_Periods_in_Years * Average_PV_Outstanding). For this exercise, assume [IDC_periodic] is a constant annual percentage derived elsewhere, or simplify to Net_IDC / (inputs.intCredit_Term / 12) / inputs.dblNAF for a simple effective annual rate. For exact replication, trace how [IDC_periodic] named range is populated, as it's not a direct output of mdlCalculation but an input.
This detailed breakdown focuses on the core cash flow and IRR mechanics, along with the handling of IDCs and Subsidies, providing the necessary steps and explanations for replication.


Now that we have established the core cash flow generation, IRR calculation, and the handling of IDCs and Subsidies, let's connect these components to the Acquisition RORAC formula. We will continue to ignore LGD, PD, CoR, and CoF derivation, meaning that for the purposes of this explanation, these components will either be assumed as inputs (if crucial for the formula's structure) or set to zero where their derivation is outside our current scope.
The Acquisition RORAC is primarily calculated within the fctCalculation_Generation function (in mdlCalculation.bas).
1. Acquisition RORAC Formula (Revisited for MBPC, Simplified Scope)
The RORAC formula for standard MBPC deals, as established, is:
code
Vba
dblAct_RORAC = (dblDeal_Rate - dblFundingR - dblSpread + ((dblPV_Capital_Advantage + dblPV_NIBL_Advantage) / dblPV_Outstanding) - (dblPV_Cost_of_Credit_Risk / dblPV_Outstanding) - (dblPV_RV_enhancements / dblPV_Outstanding) - [OPX] + [IDC_periodic]) / (dblPV_EC / dblPV_Outstanding)
For this specific deep-dive where we ignore LGD, PD, CoR, and CoF, we will make the following assumptions for the values of these components in the RORAC calculation:
dblFundingR (MFR) and dblSpread (MFS): Assumed to be 0 for this simplified scope, as their derivation relies on CoF. In a full RORAC, these would be derived via sub_CalcCF using yield and spread curves.
dblPV_Cost_of_Credit_Risk: Assumed to be 0, as its derivation relies on PD, LGD, and CoR.
dblPV_Capital_Advantage, dblPV_NIBL_Advantage, dblPV_RV_enhancements, dblPV_EC: These all represent elements of Economic Capital (EC) or related PVs. Their detailed derivations involve credit risk parameters, market risk (which itself can involve PDs), operational risk, etc. For this exercise, we will treat them as placeholders or assume them to be 0 if no external values are provided. The goal is to show how they are used in the formula, not how they are derived here.
The key components we are deriving and will use are:
dblDeal_Rate (the entity's IRR)
[IDC_periodic] (the amortized net IDC/Subsidies)
dblPV_Outstanding (Present Value of Exposure)
[OPX] (Operational Expense Rate)
2. Derivation and Use of Components in fctCalculation_Generation
The fctCalculation_Generation function generates an arrCalculation_Generation array and then aggregates its values to compute the RORAC terms.
2.1. dblDeal_Rate (Entity's IRR)
Derivation: This is directly the lContract.IRR calculated in sub_CalcCF.
Use in RORAC: It's the primary revenue component in the RORAC numerator.
... dblDeal_Rate ...
2.2. [IDC_periodic] (Periodically Amortized Initial Direct Costs / Subsidies)
Derivation: This component represents the periodic impact of the initial (dblInititial_Direct_Cost - dblSubsidies) amount. In the provided code, [IDC_periodic] is a named range on the "Index" sheet. Its value is often calculated as a spread or rate on average outstanding.
To replicate this accurately without full RORAC: If [IDC_periodic] is intended as a fixed annual rate derived from the initial net IDC/Subsidies, a simple way to calculate it would be:
Net_IDC_Initial = dblInititial_Direct_Cost - dblSubsidies
Avg_Outstanding_Approximation = dblNAF / 2 (very rough, use dblPV_Outstanding for better)
Effective_Years = intCredit_Term / 12
[IDC_periodic] = (Net_IDC_Initial / Avg_Outstanding_Approximation) / Effective_Years (as an annual rate).
More precisely: The original code's [IDC_periodic] calculation would account for the time value of money and apply the Net_IDC_Initial against the dblPV_Outstanding.
Use in RORAC: It is added to the numerator, as a positive contribution (effectively a periodic recovery or benefit from initial costs).
... + [IDC_periodic]
2.3. [OPX] (Operational Expenses)
Derivation: This is directly read from a named range [OPX] on the "Index" sheet. It is expected to be a periodic rate. The dataload function populates OPEX segments, and then a lookup (Opex_Parameter_Formula on Index sheet) derives the final [OPX] value.
Use in RORAC: It is subtracted from the numerator, as a periodic cost.
... - [OPX]
2.4. dblPV_Outstanding (Present Value of Outstanding Exposure)
This is a critical normalization factor and itself derived from the cash flow.
Derivation:
Discount Factors for Exposure: In fctCalculation_Generation, arrCalculation_Generation(j, 17) (DCF) and arrCalculation_Generation(j, 19) (DCF Interest * time) are used. These are based on the discount factors for the entity's funding curve (which we're ignoring derivation for, but for now let's assume a dummy discount rate like dblDeal_Rate if no other curve is available).
arrCalculation_Generation(j, 17) is lContract.LiqRunoff(j+1).DCF, which comes from the sub_CalcCF using the yield curve (laCurve).
arrCalculation_Generation(j, 19) is arrCalculation_Generation(j, 17) * ((arrCalculation_Generation(j, 0) - arrCalculation_Generation(j - 1, 0)) / 12). This is the DCF * time component.
Exposure per Period (arrCalculation_Generation(j, 15)): This represents the "Credit Term Runoff" (NBV).
If intRepricing_Term < intCredit_Term and [Interest_Type] <> "Fix", it uses arrResults(i).CreditRunOff (which is lContract.LiqRunoff(j+1).NBV).
Else, it's lContract.LiqRunoff(j+1).NBV (the entity's NBV, reflecting the financial outstanding including amortized IDCs/Subsidies).
For intCredit_Term periods, the NBV is tracked.
PV Calculation: dblPV_Outstanding is calculated by summing the discounted exposure for each period:
dblPV_Outstanding = Sum (arrCalculation_Generation(j, 15) (Exposure) * arrCalculation_Generation(j, 19) (DCF * time)) for j = 1 to intLoopTo.
Use in RORAC: It serves as the denominator for many components in the numerator (to express them as rates) and also as the total denominator for the final RORAC formula.

3. Simplified RORAC Calculation Components for Replication
For replication, we will simplify the terms whose derivations are currently ignored to illustrate how the structure functions.
3.1. Numerator Components:
dblDeal_Rate:
Value: pContract.IRR (from sub_CalcCF).
Role: Direct annual return rate.

Role in Formula: Normalization factor for other components and the final RORAC denominator.
3.3. Steps for Calculating RORAC (fctCalculation_Generation):
Initialize arrCalculation_Generation: Populate initial values including cash flow dates, period counters, etc.
Calculate PV Outstanding:
Loop through each cash flow period j.
Retrieve arrCalculation_Generation(j, 15) (Exposure/Credit Runoff) - which is lContract.LiqRunoff(j+1).NBV.
Retrieve arrCalculation_Generation(j, 19) (DCF * time) - these are discount factors for exposure.
Accumulate dblPV_Outstanding = Sum (Exposure_j * (DCF_j * time_j)).
Calculate Individual Numerator Components (PV-normalized):
PV_Capital_Advantage_Normalized = dblPV_Capital_Advantage / dblPV_Outstanding (if dblPV_Outstanding > 0, else 0).
PV_NIBL_Advantage_Normalized = dblPV_NIBL_Advantage / dblPV_Outstanding (if dblPV_Outstanding > 0, else 0).
PV_Cost_of_Credit_Risk_Normalized = dblPV_Cost_of_Credit_Risk / dblPV_Outstanding (if dblPV_Outstanding > 0, else 0).
PV_RV_enhancements_Normalized = dblPV_RV_enhancements / dblPV_Outstanding (if dblPV_Outstanding > 0, else 0).
PV_EC_Normalized = dblPV_EC / dblPV_Outstanding (if dblPV_Outstanding > 0, else 0).
Assemble RORAC Numerator:
Numerator = dblDeal_Rate - dblFundingR - dblSpread + PV_Capital_Advantage_Normalized + PV_NIBL_Advantage_Normalized - PV_Cost_of_Credit_Risk_Normalized - PV_RV_enhancements_Normalized - [OPX] + [IDC_periodic]
Assemble RORAC Denominator:
Denominator = PV_EC_Normalized
Final RORAC Calculation:
dblAct_RORAC = Numerator / Denominator (if Denominator > 0, else handle division by zero).
By following these steps, an LLM can implement the Acquisition RORAC calculation using the previously derived dblDeal_Rate and [IDC_periodic], while treating other complex components as explicit inputs or simplified placeholders within the RORAC formula's structure.


Let's break down how IDC upfronts and Subsidies upfront are treated in detail for standard MBPC deals, excluding wholesale and bank deals, focusing on their impact on cash flow, IRR, and the derivation of the [IDC_periodic] component for RORAC.
1. Definitions and Inputs
IDC Upfront (dblInititial_Direct_Cost or [IDC]): These are costs incurred by the financing entity at the very beginning (payout date) of the contract. Examples include commissions paid to dealers for originating the deal, or direct costs related to processing the loan. For the entity, this is a cash outflow at t=0.
Subsidies Upfront (dblSubsidies or [Subsidies]): These are benefits (often from the OEM) received by the financing entity at the payout date. Examples include incentives from Mercedes-Benz to support a particular financing offer. For the entity, this is a cash inflow at t=0.
These values are typically entered as absolute currency amounts (e.g., EUR 500 for IDC, EUR 200 for Subsidy) on the "New Input Mask" sheet.
2. Impact on Entity's Cash Flow (for dblDeal_Rate - IRR Calculation)
The dblDeal_Rate (the entity's IRR) must reflect all cash flows pertaining to the financing entity. Therefore, the IDC upfronts and Subsidies upfront are directly incorporated into the initial cash flow at the payout date (t=0).
The steps within fctCash_Flow_Generation (from mdlCash_Flow_Generation.bas) demonstrate this:
Net Financed Amount (NAF):
dblNAF = dblSales_Price + dblAdditional_Financed_Items - dblDown_Payment
This dblNAF represents the amount of principal advanced to the customer. It's a cash outflow for the entity.
Initial Cash Flow for IRR (arrCash_Flow_Generation(0, 11)):
The code explicitly sets the initial total cash flow for the entity (which is used to calculate its IRR) as:
code
Vba
arrCash_Flow_Generation(j, 11) = dblTotal_Cash_Flow_excl_IDC_Subs - dblInititial_Direct_Cost + dblSubsidies
Where dblTotal_Cash_Flow_excl_IDC_Subs at t=0 is (-dblNAF).
Therefore, the entity's initial cash flow at t=0 is:
Initial_Cash_Flow_Entity = -(dblNAF) - dblInititial_Direct_Cost + dblSubsidies
An IDC upfront (dblInititial_Direct_Cost) makes the initial cash outflow larger (more negative for the entity).
A Subsidy upfront (dblSubsidies) makes the initial cash outflow smaller (less negative for the entity, or even a net inflow if subsidies exceed NAF + IDC).
Impact on dblDeal_Rate (IRR):
The sub_CalcCF function then calculates the lContract.IRR (which becomes dblDeal_Rate) using this cash flow stream.
A higher net upfront cost (IDC > Subsidy) will reduce the calculated dblDeal_Rate (IRR) for a given customer payment schedule.
A net upfront benefit (Subsidy > IDC) will increase the calculated dblDeal_Rate (IRR).
In essence, the dblDeal_Rate fully incorporates the financial impact of the upfront IDCs and Subsidies on the entity's overall return from the deal.
3. Distinction: Customer's NBV vs. Entity's NBV
While IDCs and Subsidies impact the entity's IRR, they do not directly affect the customer's principal outstanding. The customer's loan balance (their NBV) is solely based on the dblNAF and their payments.
This distinction is crucial for accurate RORAC calculation, as several components (like Cost of Credit Risk, Economic Capital) are typically calculated on the customer's actual exposure, not the entity's "enhanced" exposure from an IDC perspective.
This leads to the concept of two NBV streams:
Entity's NBV (lContract.LiqRunoff(i).NBV): This is the outstanding balance derived directly from the cash flow used for the dblDeal_Rate (IRR). It implicitly amortizes the net upfront (IDC - Subsidies) through the interest component of the customer's payments.
Customer's NBV (arrNew_Credit_Runoff(i)): This is the hypothetical outstanding balance if the upfront (IDC - Subsidies) were not part of the initial cash flow. It reflects only the customer's true principal, dblNAF.
3.1. Derivation of Customer's NBV (arrNew_Credit_Runoff)
The mdlMain.bas module explicitly handles the creation of the arrNew_Credit_Runoff array for this purpose:
code
Vba
If [IDC] - dblSubsidies <> 0 Then
    ' Temporarily adjust the initial entity cash flow to remove IDC/Subsidy effect
    arrCF(0, 2) = arrCF(0, 2) + [IDC] - dblSubsidies
    
    ' Recalculate runoff with this adjusted cash flow (customer's perspective)
    Call sub_CalcCF(lContract, arrCF, laCurve, laSpreads, dblCalculation_Date, _
    strMM, strSW, intCompounding_Frequency, intAnnualized)
    
    ' Store this customer-facing NBV runoff
    For i = 1 To UBound(arrCF)
        arrNew_Credit_Runoff(i) = lContract.LiqRunoff(i).NBV
    Next i
    
    ' Restore the original entity cash flow
    arrCF(0, 2) = arrCF(0, 2) - [IDC] + dblSubsidies
    
    ' Recalculate runoff for the entity's perspective (important for dblDeal_Rate to be correct)
    Call sub_CalcCF(lContract, arrCF, laCurve, laSpreads, dblCalculation_Date, _
    strMM, strSW, intCompounding_Frequency, intAnnualized)
End If
arrCF(0, 2) represents the entityCashFlow at t=0 in the cash flow schedule.
This temporary adjustment allows sub_CalcCF to calculate a lContract.LiqRunoff that truly reflects the customer's principal outstanding (arrNew_Credit_Runoff), which is then used for components like LGD calculations (though we're ignoring those derivations here).
4. Derivation of [IDC_periodic] (for RORAC Numerator)
The [IDC_periodic] component in the RORAC formula is designed to explicitly "recognize" or amortize the net upfront (IDC - Subsidies) over the life of the deal. Since the dblDeal_Rate already implicitly accounts for this, [IDC_periodic] functions as an adjustment to correctly attribute profitability.
In the provided VBA, [IDC_periodic] is a named range on the "Index" sheet. The code reads from this named range rather than calculating it directly within the main RORAC loop. This implies its derivation is likely a formula or lookup on the Excel sheet itself.
Conceptual Derivation for [IDC_periodic]:
The goal is to convert the upfront Net_IDC_Initial = (dblInititial_Direct_Cost - dblSubsidies) into a periodic margin (typically an annual percentage rate) that is "earned" or "expensed" over the life of the deal.
A common approach for this in financial modeling, and consistent with the spirit of the tool, is to annualize the difference between the entity's profitability (inclusive of IDC/Subsidies) and the customer's profitability (exclusive of IDC/Subsidies), applied as a margin on the outstanding balance.
Method 1: Margin based on NBV difference (most likely implied by the code's structure):
The periodic amortization of the net IDC/Subsidy can be conceptualized as the change in the difference between the Entity's NBV and the Customer's NBV.
Net Unamortized IDC/Subsidy Balance per Period:
Unamortized_Net_IDC_j = (Entity_NBV_j - Customer_NBV_j)
Where Entity_NBV_j is lContract.LiqRunoff(j).NBV.
Where Customer_NBV_j is arrNew_Credit_Runoff(j).
Periodic Amortization Amount:
Amortization_Amount_j = Unamortized_Net_IDC_(j-1) - Unamortized_Net_IDC_j
To get [IDC_periodic] as an annual rate for the RORAC formula:
You would need to calculate the Present Value (PV) of this Amortization_Amount_j stream and express it as an annual percentage of the dblPV_Outstanding.
PV_Amortization_Amounts = Sum (Amortization_Amount_j * DCF_j) (where DCF_j are from the entity's funding curve, or even the dblDeal_Rate itself for simplicity).
[IDC_periodic] = (PV_Amortization_Amounts / dblPV_Outstanding) * Annualization_Factor
(Note: The exact implementation of [IDC_periodic] on the Index sheet might be a simplified formula, e.g., a straight-line amortization spread as a rate over the dblNAF, or a lookup based on product type. The described approach aligns with the core principles implied by the distinct NBV calculations.)
Method 2: Straight-Line Amortization (Simpler Approximation):
If the Excel named range [IDC_periodic] were to be derived simply, it might be:
Net_IDC_Initial = dblInititial_Direct_Cost - dblSubsidies
[IDC_periodic] = (Net_IDC_Initial / (intCredit_Term / 12)) / (dblNAF / (intNumber_Of_Vehicles))
This would convert the total net upfront IDC/Subsidy into an annual amount per vehicle, which then needs to be converted into a rate. To make it a rate for the RORAC formula, it's typically divided by the average outstanding balance.
For robust replication, the best approach is to examine the Excel workbook and identify the exact formula or lookup that populates the [IDC_periodic] named range. Without that, the Margin based on NBV difference is the most theoretically sound method to derive [IDC_periodic] given the other components.
5. Use of [IDC_periodic] in the RORAC Formula
Once [IDC_periodic] (as an annual rate/margin) is derived, it is directly plugged into the RORAC formula within fctCalculation_Generation:
code
Vba
dblAct_RORAC = (dblDeal_Rate - dblFundingR - dblSpread + ((dblPV_Capital_Advantage + dblPV_NIBL_Advantage) / dblPV_Outstanding) - (dblPV_Cost_of_Credit_Risk / dblPV_Outstanding) - (dblPV_RV_enhancements / dblPV_Outstanding) - [OPX] + [IDC_periodic]) / (dblPV_EC / dblPV_Outstanding)
Role: [IDC_periodic] is added to the numerator. This means it contributes positively to the RORAC. It counteracts the initial negative impact of dblInititial_Direct_Cost (if IDC > Subsidies) that lowered the dblDeal_Rate.
Why Add? The dblDeal_Rate already has the upfront net IDC/Subsidies "baked in" as a negative component. By adding [IDC_periodic] back, the RORAC is effectively re-spreading that initial impact over time as a positive margin earned on the outstanding exposure. This makes the dblDeal_Rate component in the RORAC conceptually closer to a "pure" customer rate, with IDC and other costs explicitly broken out as separate line items in the numerator.
In summary, IDC upfronts and Subsidies upfront are handled by:
Immediate Impact: Directly affecting the initial cash flow for the entity, thus determining the dblDeal_Rate (IRR).
Separate NBV: Requiring a separate calculation of the customer's NBV (arrNew_Credit_Runoff) to isolate the true principal outstanding.
Periodic Amortization: Being transformed into a periodic rate ([IDC_periodic]) for the RORAC numerator, often by annualizing the difference between entity and customer NBVs. This allows the RORAC formula to explicitly show this cost/benefit over the deal's life.


1. The Crucial Missing Link: [IDC_periodic] Found
The most significant finding is in cell V43 of the New Input Mask sheet, which corresponds to the "IDC, Subs. and Fees (perio.)" line item in the RORAC calculation.
[N43] Value: IDC, Subs. and Fees (perio.)
[V43] Formula: =INDEX!B291
The named range IDC_periodic also refers to INDEX!$B$291.
This explicitly confirms that the [IDC_periodic] value used in the RORAC calculation is directly pulled from cell B291 on the INDEX sheet.
While the provided data dump does not show the formula in cell INDEX!B291 itself, its role is now unambiguous. It is the cell that converts the upfront (IDC - Subsidies) into the periodic rate required for the RORAC formula.
2. Detailed RORAC Calculation Scheme (from New Input Mask Sheet)
The formulas in cells V25 through V49 provide a complete, step-by-step breakdown of the RORAC calculation. An LLM can replicate this logic precisely.
2.1. Numerator: Net EBIT Margin ([V45] Formula)
The numerator of the RORAC is the "Net EBIT Margin," calculated in cell V45 as: =(V37-V39-V41+V43). Let's break down its components:
V37 (Net Interest Margin): =(V33+V35)
V33 (Gross Interest Margin): =(V29-V31)
V29 (Deal Rate (IRR)): =Mdl_IRR
Source: This is the IRR calculated by the VBA sub_CalcCF function. It is the entity's IRR, which includes the impact of upfront IDC and Subsidies in the initial cash flow.
V31 (Cost of Debt): =(Mdl_MFR+Mdl_MFS)
Source: The sum of Matched Funding Rate and Matched Funding Spread, both calculated by the VBA sub_CalcCF function. (Currently ignored in our scope, but this confirms their role).
V35 (Capital Advantage): =IF(Country_Short="USA",(Mdl_Funding_Adjustment+Mdl_NIBL_Adjustment)+Tax_Benefit_US,(Mdl_Funding_Adjustment+Mdl_NIBL_Adjustment))
Source: For non-USA cases, this is the sum of Mdl_Funding_Adjustment and Mdl_NIBL_Adjustment, which are calculated in VBA (fctCalculation_Generation).
V39 (Standard Cost Credit Risk): =(Mdl_CoCR+Mdl_CoRVR)
Source: The sum of the PV-normalized Cost of Credit Risk and Cost of RV Risk, calculated in VBA. (Ignored in our scope, but role is confirmed).
V41 (OPEX): =OPX
Source: A direct value from the named range OPX, which is determined by parameter lookups.
V43 (IDC, Subs. and Fees (perio.)): =INDEX!B291
Source: This is the periodic rate representing the amortized net upfront IDC and Subsidies.
The complete RORAC Numerator is: (Deal Rate - Cost of Debt) + Capital Advantage - Cost of Credit Risk - OPEX + IDC_periodic
2.2. Denominator: Economic Capital ([V47] Formula)
The denominator of the RORAC is the "Economic Capital" rate.
V47 (Economic Capital): =Mdl_EC
Source: This is the total PV-normalized Economic Capital, calculated in VBA (fctCalculation_Generation). (Ignored in our scope, but role is confirmed).
2.3. Final RORAC Calculation ([V49] Formula)
V49 (RORAC): =(V45/V47)
Formula: Net EBIT Margin / Economic Capital
This provides a clear, replicable structure for the final RORAC assembly.
3. The Final Gap: The Formula for INDEX!B291
We now know exactly what INDEX!B291 needs to represent: the periodic rate equivalent of the upfront (IDC - Subsidies) amount.
Given the available components (IDC, Subsidies, and mdl_PV_Outstanding), the most logical and financially sound formula to place in INDEX!B291 would be:
code
Excel
=(IDC - Subsidies) / mdl_PV_Outstanding
Why this formula is correct:
Unit Consistency: The RORAC numerator sums up several annual rates or margins (Deal Rate, Cost of Debt, OPEX, etc.). [IDC_periodic] must also be in this format.
Conversion from Absolute to Rate:
IDC - Subsidies is an absolute upfront amount (e.g., EUR 300).
mdl_PV_Outstanding (from INDEX!$M$153) is the total present value of the deal's exposure over its lifetime. It represents the total amount of capital "at work" in present value terms.
Dividing the absolute upfront amount by the total PV of exposure converts the upfront cost/benefit into a ratio or margin relative to the size of the deal's exposure. This ratio can then be treated as an equivalent periodic rate in the RORAC numerator.
Example:
IDC = 500
Subsidies = 200
Net_IDC_Upfront = 300 (a cost)
mdl_PV_Outstanding = 50,000
Formula in INDEX!B291: =(500 - 200) / 50000 = 0.006 or 0.6%.
This 0.6% is then used in cell V43 and added to the RORAC numerator.
This approach correctly accounts for the upfront financial impact by spreading it across the entire deal's exposure in a time-value-of-money consistent manner.
4. Instructions for Another LLM to Implement
You now have a complete blueprint.
Step 1: Implement Core Cash Flow and IRR Logic
Follow the detailed breakdown from the previous response to implement fctCash_Flow_Generation and sub_CalcCF.
This will produce the dblDeal_Rate (Mdl_IRR) and the two NBV runoffs (Entity and Customer-facing arrNew_Credit_Runoff).
Step 2: Calculate Present Value of Outstanding (mdl_PV_Outstanding)
Using the lContract.LiqRunoff (which contains discount factors from the yield curve), calculate mdl_PV_Outstanding as detailed in the previous response (Sum (Exposure_j * (DCF_j * time_j))).
Step 3: Calculate the IDC_periodic Rate
Retrieve the upfront IDC and Subsidies inputs.
Calculate Net_IDC_Upfront = IDC - Subsidies.
Calculate IDC_periodic_Rate = Net_IDC_Upfront / mdl_PV_Outstanding. Handle division-by-zero if mdl_PV_Outstanding is zero.
Step 4: Assemble the RORAC Numerator (Net EBIT Margin)
Define placeholders for components currently ignored: Cost_of_Debt = 0, Capital_Advantage = 0, Cost_of_Credit_Risk = 0.
Retrieve the OPX rate from inputs.
Calculate the numerator:
Numerator = dblDeal_Rate - Cost_of_Debt + Capital_Advantage - Cost_of_Credit_Risk - OPX + IDC_periodic_Rate
Step 5: Assemble the RORAC Denominator
Define a placeholder for Economic_Capital_Rate = 0 (or an input value if provided).
Step 6: Calculate Final RORAC
Acquisition_RORAC = Numerator / Economic_Capital_Rate. Handle division-by-zero.
This provides a complete, replicable logic flow from raw deal inputs to the final RORAC calculation, with the critical IDC_periodic component now clearly defined.


Excellent. The provided sheet data, especially the formulas from the New Input Mask and INDEX sheets, fills in the final critical gaps. We now have a complete and detailed logical map for how the Acquisition RORAC is calculated, with a clear understanding of how Initial Direct Costs (IDCs) and Subsidies are treated.
Here is a comprehensive, step-by-step guide designed for another LLM to replicate the logic for a standard MBPC deal, focusing on IRR, IDCs, Subsidies, and the overall RORAC structure.
1. Overview of the RORAC Calculation Logic
The calculation is a multi-layered process that can be broken down into three main stages:
VBA-Driven Cash Flow and IRR Calculation: The core engine (prcStartCalculation and its sub-functions) generates a detailed cash flow schedule for the financing entity. This schedule includes all customer payments, the initial Net Amount Financed (NAF), and critically, the upfront IDC and Subsidy cash flows at t=0. It then calculates the entity's Internal Rate of Return (Mdl_IRR) from this complete cash flow stream.
Excel-Based Component Calculation and Normalization: The VBA populates raw periodic data (like cash flows, runoffs, etc.) onto the hidden INDEX sheet. Formulas on this sheet then aggregate and normalize these data streams into single, annualized percentage rates. The most important of these are the OPX rate and the IDC_periodic rate.
Final RORAC Assembly: The New Input Mask sheet serves as the final presentation layer. It pulls all the calculated components (the IRR from VBA, the rates from the INDEX sheet) and assembles them into a clear Profit & Loss (P&L) statement that culminates in the final RORAC percentage.
2. Detailed Treatment of Upfront IDCs and Subsidies
This is the most critical logic to replicate correctly. The tool uses a sophisticated two-part approach to account for them.
2.1. Part 1: Impact on the Deal Rate (IRR)
Upfront IDCs and Subsidies are treated as cash flows occurring at the inception of the deal (t=0) from the entity's perspective.
Initial Entity Cash Outflow = NAF + IDC - Subsidies
NAF (Net Amount Financed) = Sales_Price + Additional_Financed_Items - Downpayment.
The VBA function sub_CalcCF calculates the Mdl_IRR (the entity's IRR, which becomes the Deal Rate in the RORAC P&L) based on this initial outflow and all subsequent customer payments.
Result: The Mdl_IRR implicitly "bakes in" the financial impact of these upfront items. A net cost (IDC > Subsidies) will lower the IRR compared to the nominal customer rate, while a net benefit (Subsidies > IDC) will increase it.
2.2. Part 2: Explicit Representation in the RORAC P&L
The RORAC P&L on the New Input Mask sheet explicitly shows this impact as a separate line item.
Line Item: "IDC, Subsidies and Fees(upfront) / lost interest"
Cell: 'New Input Mask'!V27
Formula: =-(IF(AND(Country_Short="MEX",...), H54%-Mdl_IRR, Mdl_NOM_CR-Mdl_IRR))
Logic for MBPC (non-Mexico): =-(Mdl_NOM_CR - Mdl_IRR)
This formula calculates the spread difference between the nominal customer rate (Mdl_NOM_CR) and the actual deal IRR (Mdl_IRR).
This spread is precisely the annualized percentage impact of the net upfront (IDC - Subsidies).
For example, if the customer rate is 5% but due to a 300 EUR net IDC, the entity's IRR is only 4.4%, this line will show -(5% - 4.4%) = -0.6%. This correctly represents the "cost" of the upfront items as a negative margin.
This two-part treatment is key: The IRR reflects the true yield, and the RORAC P&L transparently separates the pure customer-rate-driven margin from the impact of upfronts.
3. Detailed Calculation of Other RORAC Components
Here is the step-by-step logic for deriving each component, based on the provided formulas.
3.1. OPEX (Operational Expenses)
Source: The value is determined by the formula in the named range OPX (INDEX!$B$166).
Formula: =IF(Opex_Parameter<>"Yes", Opex_Segment, VLOOKUP(Opex_Segment, Matching_Table_OPEX, 2, 0)) (simplified for non-Mexico).
Replication Steps:
Check an input flag, Opex_Parameter.
If it is not "Yes", use the value from another input, Opex_Segment.
If it is "Yes", get the user-selected Opex_Segment (e.g., "MB PC - retail business" from 'New Input Mask'!G27).
Perform a VLOOKUP on this segment against a parameter table (Matching_Table_OPEX, which is the data you provided from Data_Entities!D6283:E6323).
For "MB PC - retail business", the lookup would return 0.023291....
This rate is used directly in cell 'New Input Mask'!V41.
3.2. Periodic Fees and Subsidies (IDC_periodic)
Source: This value comes from the named range IDC_periodic (INDEX!$B$291). It relates only to the periodic fees entered in 'New Input Mask'!H41.
Formula: =IF(fees_per_basis=AY3, 'New Input Mask'!H41/INDEX!B292, IF(fees_per_basis=AY4, 'New Input Mask'!H41/INDEX!B293, 'New Input Mask'!H41%))
Replication Steps:
Get the user-entered periodic fee amount from 'New Input Mask'!H41.
Get the selected unit for this fee from fees_per_basis_inp ('New Input Mask'!F41), which populates the named range fees_per_basis (INDEX!B290).
Implement the IF logic:
If the unit is "Total life amount in" (INDEX!AY3), divide the amount by the value in INDEX!B292. INDEX!B292's formula is =SUM(F425:F545)/12, which is an approximation of the average outstanding balance over the life of the deal.
If the unit is "Total per anno amount in" (INDEX!AY4), divide the amount by the value in INDEX!B293. INDEX!B293's formula is =SUM(F425:F545)/Maturity, another approximation of average outstanding.
Otherwise (if the unit is "% per anno"), simply convert the amount in H41 to a percentage.
The result of this formula is the value used in cell 'New Input Mask'!V43.
4. Final RORAC Assembly for an LLM to Implement
An LLM should replicate the RORAC P&L as laid out on the New Input Mask sheet.
Inputs to this stage:
Mdl_IRR (IRR calculated by VBA)
Mdl_MFR, Mdl_MFS (CoF calculated by VBA, assumed 0 for this scope)
Mdl_Funding_Adjustment, Mdl_NIBL_Adjustment (PV-normalized advantages from VBA, assumed 0)
Mdl_CoCR, Mdl_CoRVR (PV-normalized risk costs from VBA, assumed 0)
OPX (Calculated via lookup as described above)
IDC_periodic (Calculated from periodic fees as described above)
Mdl_EC (Total EC from VBA, placeholder)
Calculation Steps (mirroring the Excel formulas):
V29_Deal_Rate = Mdl_IRR
V31_Cost_of_Debt = Mdl_MFR + Mdl_MFS
V33_Gross_Interest_Margin = V29_Deal_Rate - V31_Cost_of_Debt
V35_Capital_Advantage = Mdl_Funding_Adjustment + Mdl_NIBL_Adjustment
V37_Net_Interest_Margin = V33_Gross_Interest_Margin + V35_Capital_Advantage
V39_Standard_Cost_Credit_Risk = Mdl_CoCR + Mdl_CoRVR
V41_OPEX = OPX
V43_IDC_Periodic = IDC_periodic
V45_Net_EBIT_Margin = V37_Net_Interest_Margin - V39_Standard_Cost_Credit_Risk - V41_OPEX + V43_IDC_Periodic
V47_Economic_Capital = Mdl_EC
V49_RORAC = V45_Net_EBIT_Margin / V47_Economic_Capital (handle division by zero).
