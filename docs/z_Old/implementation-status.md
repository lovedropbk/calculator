# Financial Calculator Implementation Status Report

Generated: 2025-09-18  
Architecture Version: Walk (Native Windows)  
Previous: Wails/React (deprecated)

## Executive Summary

The Financial Calculator has transitioned from a Wails/React architecture to a native Windows Walk framework. Core calculation engines are partially implemented, and the Walk UI provides basic functionality. Significant work remains to achieve the full MVP specification.

## Architecture Migration Status

### ✅ Completed Migration
- Switched from Wails v2 + React to Walk (native Windows)
- Updated architecture documentation to reflect Walk framework
- Removed dependency on web technologies (React, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Established build pipeline with `walkui` build tag

### ⚠️ Legacy Code
- Wails/React code remains under `/frontend` (unmaintained, for reference only)
- `main.go` and `app.go` (Wails entrypoints) not present/migrated
- Parameter service designed for Wails needs adaptation for Walk

- **Walk UI limitations** may require workarounds
- **Single-platform** (Windows only) limits reach

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Focus on engine completion before UI enhancements
2. Implement comprehensive testing early
3. Create manual validation procedures
4. Consider web API for cross-platform access

The Walk UI, while functional, needs several key features for business utility.

Estimated effort to MVP: **6-8 weeks** with a team of 3-4 developers.
Estimated effort to production: **10-12 weeks** including comprehensive testing and documentation.
